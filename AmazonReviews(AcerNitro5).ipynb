       "['This is a great entry gaming laptop for my 12 year old who will be 13 next month. The colors and graphics are great  he loves the lighted keyboard  and this definitely has a bit of weight which contributes to the sturdiness. I also like that it s also just a great laptop as well. We were able to upgrade for Windows 11 for free. At home  he now uses this computer vs the school assigned Chrome  for his Zoom math tutoring sessions (the camera and microphone is decent we still use a separate microphone)  and to also complete his homework on Google classroom.Other features: I also like the number of inputs which has more than my Lenovo X1 Carbon ThinkPad  and the ability to wirelessly connect the laptop to your tv as a second extended screen is pretty cool.Overall this was a present for his good grades  and it also works great for homework assignments and video conferencing as added bonuses.',\n",
       " 'I m definitely loving this laptop.I have a gaming rig with a Ryzen 5 3rd gen and XFX main card  and this laptop holds up with all the AAA titles I play on my big rig  BUT I can take it anywhere!The only reason this gets a 4 star is because it clearly states that there are supposed to be 2 stick (PCIE) SSD slots with a 2.5  HDD port to upgrade storage.When I popped this bugger open to add storage and RAM  low and behold I find it has only 1 stick SSD slots and a 2.5 Luckily I bought a 2.5  SSD instead of a stick (PCIE) since this thing clearly has a spot on the MB to have that extra PCIE slot but there is nothing there. So basically I get 1 PCIE and 1 2.5  HDD port instead of 2.Super disappointed  considering there is even a Nitro 5 sticker that says  Available slots: 2 SSD  1 HDD Unfortunately not true at all.....',\n",
       " 'Unfortunately  the unit won t power on. I can t tell if it s the laptop itself or if it s a bad power supply?Update: user error. I wasn t plugging in the power cord all the way as seen in the picture',\n",
       " 'I got this because Acer told me this was compatible with Oculus 2. When I received it  it was not compatible. When I contacted Acer support. Support told me I needed to purchase a model with 32MB memory. Sales tells you one thing  support tells you another. I got the better model at $1400. That one did not work either.',\n",
       " 'I am a 66yr old man with Red/Green colour blindness. The keyboard was so hard to read (even on full brightness) that I sent it back on that alone. If you are a young dude or someone with good eyesight it won t be a problem to you. I also learned that some Nitro s have a menu where you can change the keyboard colour  not my one. I learnt:  Turn the lights off and see what colour the keys are  if White you have RGB if Red  they stay Red.',\n",
       " 'Goodness. I ordered one of these laptops  only to have it arrive and find it has a defective charging port (I noticed it  and a representative at Best Buy confirmed)  there was a bent prong in the port. I talked to an Amazon rep  and they sent me a replacement. Having gotten now a 2nd laptop with the same defect  I can confidently say to STAY AWAY from this. I was really looking forward to using this laptop  and even used my free trial of Amazon prime I d been saving so I could get it over my vacation from work. Having gotten two defective laptops just killed that for me.',\n",
       " 'Just to cut to it  this specific model of the Nitro 5 is incredibly a solid all-around; from the lots of room to expand storage/RAM  great keyboard  good cooling  etc.. The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPS.The negatives for me come in two-fold: the display and battery life.1. The display being 144hz and IPS is great and all  but the actual quality of it is below mediocre. While backlight bleed is expected for an IPS panel  it s weirdly uneven and discolored. Also  I m not sure if it s a defect with my specific device  but the display can t produce the color red accurately (it s more orangish) and overall things look a bit flat and there s no way to actually fix it besides finding your own ICC file. And even then you might as well use an external monitor.2. The battery life is terrible. Even on powersaving mode the laptop barely lasts 5 hours  and that s just doing basic internet browsing. I m honestly considering not being bothered with it and just removing the battery entirely.',\n",
       " 'I had this laptop about 3 months now and everything still seems to be doing pretty good. the temp never went over 200 degrees F... but I do have it on a cooling pad  and I turn the internal cooling fans on the highest settings with the nitro sense when i play something somewhat intensive and I don t play many intensive games. the I5 core will most likely have a rough time playing the latest games but it will run something like escape from tarkov like butter at 75 to over 100 fps in ultra-settings. you might want to get another 8gig stick of ram to pop in and upgrade the ssd storage but over all I m very satisfied for what this computer is and can do. it is my very first gaming laptop and I feel it somewhat replaced my xbox. for someone who s never had a dedicated laptop for gaming or a computer at all  I feel this is one of the best first steps into pc gaming.',\n",
       " 'For a budget gaming laptop  this Acer Nitro 5 has good enough specs  the Core i5 and the RTX 3050 are sufficient. The problem and it s a big one  is the display. The image on this laptop is AWFUL. No matter how much I tried to calibrate the colors  it looks bad. The colors are washed and the screen is dim. whether it s game or a movie this screen won t do it justice. Too bad because I like many other aspects of this laptop like the relatively long battery life and the red-colored keyboard. I find myself playing more on my 2 years old Legion 5 which looks way better than this newer Acer Nitro 5. Even for under $1000  you can get something better.',\n",
       " 'So i got this and I don t really mess with these things but what pisses me off is haven t to fix every little thing. This laptop well really good for like a week or two until i noticed stupid frame drops  fortnite literately being unplayable and all. I then found the darn reason  I used Intel Xtu and saw the problem  overheating every darn time. I have a coolpad for this and my room is literally cold not blazin hot but yeah the cpu will hit 90 degrees! The gpu temps are always fine but the cpu sucks so hard so no wonder fortnite is unplayable. I found a couple options on reddit  they were to fix it myself by buying thermal paste  send it to acer to add shitty thermal paste so i can have this problem in a couple weeks again  or return and refund. Thing is  i got this well priced and the 3050 does what i need it for. I kid you not i play almost every game nearly max with optimizations done at that 144 fps and i have used programs to see my avg so yeah. Forza horizon 5 is the only thing I can t run at those frames cause the gpu has too few ram or whatever it uses  it s only 4gb. And yeah i did buy additional 8gb ram and 1tb ssd.So yeah  the games run well (overwatch  apex  definitely not fortnite  rainbow 6 ).But it has heating issues  I m personally going to exchange this and see if amazon does my a biggie by sending a unit before i send this one in cause i need a laptop  i know they did me this one time with another big purchase so shoutout to them.Edit: forgot to include that yes even with max fans the cpu thermal throttles. I know how to use nitrosence.',\n",
       " 'The media could not be loaded. \\xa0It s a great laptop  able to upgrade as you please and has a backlit keyboard (no it does not change color). The keyboard isn t loud and feels comfortable to type on. I love how the charging port is behind the laptop instead of on the side as it would get in the way. I m glad I chose this laptop as my first. I recommend buying this if you enjoy playing games as much as I do.',\n",

       " 'Got this machine for my kids for general use and gaming. There were a few negative Amazon reviews which I wanted to add some perspective to - in case it helps someone.1) The packaging was excellent for the laptop itself. In its original ACER box  it has 1.5 - 2 inches of high density foam protecting the laptop. Honestly  I think the laptop could be shipped in this packaging alone and be fine. I did get 2 laptops and both were boxed together (both acer boxes were shipped in a larger box). While they were not packed tightly  they arrived undamaged (no box chafing  dents  or slashes)2) The male end of the power supply which plugs into the back of the laptop must be firmly pressed until it clicks. There is a detent which I had missed initially  until I pressed harder. You know its fully seated when it clicks  but also when the blue charge light goes on. Without having the power supply fully seated  you will not be able to power on the device. I could imagine someone receiving the laptop and thinking it was DOA because they did not fully seat the connector.I ve had a total of 6 ACER laptops in my household (all have been hassle free machines). We ll see how durable they are  but based on my first impression of prior history with this brand  I would buy this product again.',\n",
       " 'I received this laptop and pulled it right out the box only to learn that it does not work!! The repair for the laptop has been an absolute nightmare!! I was responsible for packaging this laptop up to send in for repair and finding a local fedex to ship it out of which was also a horrible experience!! According to the company  my repair is complete and now lies in the hands of fedex! I wish I could get rid of this headache by simply returning the product back to Amazon but I don t even have the product to send back!! Worse decision ever was purchasing this laptop! Be careful!!',\n",
       " 'I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050. I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn t gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you ll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall  this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me. If you are going to buy a laptop for any reason  might as well get a gaming one like this!',\n",
       " 'This is my first laptop after a decade and I am very happy to purchase this one. So many good words about Nitro 5s  even this one is not one of the better ones  I added another 8Gb ram and 2 TB 2.5 SSD to make it bit more usable. Not that anything wrong with 8Gb ram and 256Gb SSD but 8Gb rams are not that expensive at all these days.. I had 2TB SSD from my big computer  just switched it over. Talking about upgrading the laptop  it s so easy. Comes with everything you need to add another 2.5 SSD. YouTube videos helped me out though  made my job a lot easier. This computer does play FPS games  and plays them very smooth. The fans start running though  and you might think it s overheating  that s not the case  it s normal. They don t go full speed. I also play mobile games and stream through laptop... no heating no fan issues at all... it s like so smooth and easy for the machine. For this price  I highly recommend it  if you are in a tight budged like I am. One more thing for this laptop  I am going to travel Europe next year  and it won t be problem bringing it with me  since it is travel friendly :)',\n",

       " 'Model: Acer Nitro 5 AN515-55-53E5 -Upgrade & Linux infoMy first order of this came DOA. It happens sometimes. The replacement came quickly. this has 2x M.2 NVME slots. I added a Samsung 980 1TB (no need to buy an extra screw). I also added another 8GB ram Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 2666 MHz CL19 Laptop Memory. By adding things myself it made it cheaper than buying a more expensive unit. Yes it is only an I5 but I do not need a lot. I does exactly what I need and well. Battery life is about 2 or 3 hours depending on what youre doing. I always expect horrible battery life so Im not shocked. the keys feel nice. red backlit only (Meh) but the intensity can be decreased or increased via the keys in Linux & Windows.LINUX - load Windows into safe mode  go into bios  ctrl + S will show the add the option to allow you to change the mode to AHCI. reboot to windows and take it back out of safe mode. Install linux as normal. For this unit I install ElementaryOS with zero issues and left windows on the factory NVME. Everything works as expected including the microphone and camera. I would recommend a mouse & mousepad but thats your call. If you are nervous about installing linux or it is your first time  remove the 256GB nvme  install linux on the added drive  replace 256GB  update grub [ sudo update-grub]. Hope this helps someone out there. I know the open source community and Linux always look for someone who has run gauntlet to see how it works. My husband is still fighting an HP Omen because Intel and their Microphone :)']"

       "'This is a great entry gaming laptop for my 12 year old who will be 13 next month. The colors and graphics are great  he loves the lighted keyboard  and this definitely has a bit of weight which contributes to the sturdiness. I also like that it s also just a great laptop as well. We were able to upgrade for Windows 11 for free. At home  he now uses this computer vs the school assigned Chrome  for his Zoom math tutoring sessions (the camera and microphone is decent we still use a separate microphone)  and to also complete his homework on Google classroom.Other features: I also like the number of inputs which has more than my Lenovo X1 Carbon ThinkPad  and the ability to wirelessly connect the laptop to your tv as a second extended screen is pretty cool.Overall this was a present for his good grades  and it also works great for homework assignments and video conferencing as added bonuses. I m definitely loving this laptop.I have a gaming rig with a Ryzen 5 3rd gen and XFX main card  and this laptop holds up with all the AAA titles I play on my big rig  BUT I can take it anywhere!The only reason this gets a 4 star is because it clearly states that there are supposed to be 2 stick (PCIE) SSD slots with a 2.5  HDD port to upgrade storage.When I popped this bugger open to add storage and RAM  low and behold I find it has only 1 stick SSD slots and a 2.5 Luckily I bought a 2.5  SSD instead of a stick (PCIE) since this thing clearly has a spot on the MB to have that extra PCIE slot but there is nothing there. So basically I get 1 PCIE and 1 2.5  HDD port instead of 2.Super disappointed  considering there is even a Nitro 5 sticker that says  Available slots: 2 SSD  1 HDD Unfortunately not true at all..... Unfortunately  the unit won t power on. I can t tell if it s the laptop itself or if it s a bad power supply?Update: user error. I wasn t plugging in the power cord all the way as seen in the picture I got this because Acer told me this was compatible with Oculus 2. When I received it  it was not compatible. When I contacted Acer support. Support told me I needed to purchase a model with 32MB memory. Sales tells you one thing  support tells you another. I got the better model at $1400. That one did not work either. I am a 66yr old man with Red/Green colour blindness. The keyboard was so hard to read (even on full brightness) that I sent it back on that alone. If you are a young dude or someone with good eyesight it won t be a problem to you. I also learned that some Nitro s have a menu where you can change the keyboard colour  not my one. I learnt:  Turn the lights off and see what colour the keys are  if White you have RGB if Red  they stay Red. Goodness. I ordered one of these laptops  only to have it arrive and find it has a defective charging port (I noticed it  and a representative at Best Buy confirmed)  there was a bent prong in the port. I talked to an Amazon rep  and they sent me a replacement. Having gotten now a 2nd laptop with the same defect  I can confidently say to STAY AWAY from this. I was really looking forward to using this laptop  and even used my free trial of Amazon prime I d been saving so I could get it over my vacation from work. Having gotten two defective laptops just killed that for me. Just to cut to it  this specific model of the Nitro 5 is incredibly a solid all-around; from the lots of room to expand storage/RAM  great keyboard  good cooling  etc.. The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPS.The negatives for me come in two-fold: the display and battery life.1. The display being 144hz and IPS is great and all  but the actual quality of it is below mediocre. While backlight bleed is expected for an IPS panel  it s weirdly uneven and discolored. Also  I m not sure if it s a defect with my specific device  but the display can t produce the color red accurately (it s more orangish) and overall things look a bit flat and there s no way to actually fix it besides finding your own ICC file. And even then you might as well use an external monitor.2. The battery life is terrible. Even on powersaving mode the laptop barely lasts 5 hours  and that s just doing basic internet browsing. I m honestly considering not being bothered with it and just removing the battery entirely. I had this laptop about 3 months now and everything still seems to be doing pretty good. the temp never went over 200 degrees F... but I do have it on a cooling pad  and I turn the internal cooling fans on the highest settings with the nitro sense when i play something somewhat intensive and I don t play many intensive games. the I5 core will most likely have a rough time playing the latest games but it will run something like escape from tarkov like butter at 75 to over 100 fps in ultra-settings. you might want to get another 8gig stick of ram to pop in and upgrade the ssd storage but over all I m very satisfied for what this computer is and can do. it is my very first gaming laptop and I feel it somewhat replaced my xbox. for someone who s never had a dedicated laptop for gaming or a computer at all  I feel this is one of the best first steps into pc gaming. For a budget gaming laptop  this Acer Nitro 5 has good enough specs  the Core i5 and the RTX 3050 are sufficient. The problem and it s a big one  is the display. The image on this laptop is AWFUL. No matter how much I tried to calibrate the colors  it looks bad. The colors are washed and the screen is dim. whether it s game or a movie this screen won t do it justice. Too bad because I like many other aspects of this laptop like the relatively long battery life and the red-colored keyboard. I find myself playing more on my 2 years old Legion 5 which looks way better than this newer Acer Nitro 5. Even for under $1000  you can get something better. So i got this and I don t really mess with these things but what pisses me off is haven t to fix every little thing. This laptop well really good for like a week or two until i noticed stupid frame drops  fortnite literately being unplayable and all. I then found the darn reason  I used Intel Xtu and saw the problem  overheating every darn time. I have a coolpad for this and my room is literally cold not blazin hot but yeah the cpu will hit 90 degrees! The gpu temps are always fine but the cpu sucks so hard so no wonder fortnite is unplayable. I found a couple options on reddit  they were to fix it myself by buying thermal paste  send it to acer to add shitty thermal paste so i can have this problem in a couple weeks again  or return and refund. Thing is  i got this well priced and the 3050 does what i need it for. I kid you not i play almost every game nearly max with optimizations done at that 144 fps and i have used programs to see my avg so yeah. Forza horizon 5 is the only thing I can t run at those frames cause the gpu has too few ram or whatever it uses  it s only 4gb. And yeah i did buy additional 8gb ram and 1tb ssd.So yeah  the games run well (overwatch  apex  definitely not fortnite  rainbow 6 ).But it has heating issues  I m personally going to exchange this and see if amazon does my a biggie by sending a unit before i send this one in cause i need a laptop  i know they did me this one time with another big purchase so shoutout to them.Edit: forgot to include that yes even with max fans the cpu thermal throttles. I know how to use nitrosence. The media could not be loaded. \\xa0It s a great laptop  able to upgrade as you please and has a backlit keyboard (no it does not change color). The keyboard isn t loud and feels comfortable to type on. I love how the charging port is behind the laptop instead of on the side as it would get in the way. I m glad I chose this laptop as my first. I recommend buying this if you enjoy playing games as much as I do. After paying a chunk of money for this laptop  you ld think that it would be well protected for shipping with something more than one sheet of paper. Look at the size of that shipping box! Sure hope it works... Got this machine for my kids for general use and gaming. There were a few negative Amazon reviews which I wanted to add some perspective to - in case it helps someone.1) The packaging was excellent for the laptop itself. In its original ACER box  it has 1.5 - 2 inches of high density foam protecting the laptop. Honestly  I think the laptop could be shipped in this packaging alone and be fine. I did get 2 laptops and both were boxed together (both acer boxes were shipped in a larger box). While they were not packed tightly  they arrived undamaged (no box chafing  dents  or slashes)2) The male end of the power supply which plugs into the back of the laptop must be firmly pressed until it clicks. There is a detent which I had missed initially  until I pressed harder. You know its fully seated when it clicks  but also when the blue charge light goes on. Without having the power supply fully seated  you will not be able to power on the device. I could imagine someone receiving the laptop and thinking it was DOA because they did not fully seat the connector.I ve had a total of 6 ACER laptops in my household (all have been hassle free machines). We ll see how durable they are  but based on my first impression of prior history with this brand  I would buy this product again. I received this laptop and pulled it right out the box only to learn that it does not work!! The repair for the laptop has been an absolute nightmare!! I was responsible for packaging this laptop up to send in for repair and finding a local fedex to ship it out of which was also a horrible experience!! According to the company  my repair is complete and now lies in the hands of fedex! I wish I could get rid of this headache by simply returning the product back to Amazon but I don t even have the product to send back!! Worse decision ever was purchasing this laptop! Be careful!! I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050. I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn t gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you ll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall  this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me.

My husband is still fighting an HP Omen because Intel and their Microphone :) Got one brand new and it didn t even charge or turn on. A very expensive paper weight. The case is great  super slim and modern. The keyboard is only red  no customization. Keep having an issue with the audio driver. Will randomly stop all audio output and will tell me no audio device installed. Good for games like minecraft and roblox  but seemed to get choppy with Stormworks. Tiene un rendimiento excelente para su precio. Refrigera muy bien lo cual es estupendo ya que vivo en un 치rea calurosa  los videojuegos corren perfectos a m치s de 170fps con m치xima calidad y eso que a칰n no le hago overclock al chip de video ni al procesador. Lo 칰nico que no me gust칩 es que la bios viene muy  muy restringida. The nitro 5  ANY MODEL is supposed to have one free year of acer 24/7 technical support. It did not come with it. Awesome laptop with an awesome price. I could not give any higher praise. And it is easily upgradeable. The RAM can be upgraded  and I bought the Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 here on Amazon. Easily installed to give the laptop a total of 16GB but you can upgrade it even higher. Next upgrade will be a 1TB SSD  because the only part that would take away from this amazing laptop is the low amount of storage but their are options to increase that as well. I only got the 256GB SSD.Thanks for reading! My son got this laptop for Christmas and he loves it. Great beginner gaming laptop! It was super easy to setup! Literally set everything up in less than 30 minutes. Worth every penny so fart!! Great laptop  fast too. Destiny 2 originally played at 80+fps when I updated the drivers for gaming it dropped to 30fps why?!?! The power supply has to be plugged in VERY firmly to the back of the laptop... It didn t look like it could go farther in  and the laptop wasn t charging. I pressed again really firmly and heard a click  then it finally started to charge. Does not turn on. Never had an issue like this with a brand new computer. Returning today. Took and it out of the box and it was doa. So sent it back Donot waste your money. It arrived dead and would not turn on. I bought it for my son s birthday. Not only it arroved broken but also was late on delivery! Please send a new power adaptor - the three circles will NOT fit... need a new one ASAP I am not at all disappointed with this laptop! Screen is beautiful. It is super fast! It does need an upgrade in memory(8GB for $40) and HDD(1TB for $80)  but it appears to be pretty easy to access and upgrade. They even give you the cable for the HDD upgrade. Will be testing out a few games  in the next couple days. Did not purchase for high end gaming  so I think I will be pleased  based on how quickly this thing moves for everyday activities! I ordered this gaming laptop so that my son (9) and I could play online games together. This was a Christmas gift. It DOES NOT WORK. It will not turn on  charged or uncharged  while plugged into any of three different outlets  all of which work for other devices. Basically  I was sent a $1000 non-functional device. This is unacceptable at best and my son is DEVASTATED. I cannot begin to express how upset I am with this. Bought this for my wife to do audio video processing and some light gaming. I upgraded it out of the box to 16gb of ram and added a 1tb nvme m.2 drive. It works perfect and can handle any video editing and even very modern game titles with ease. With right at $1000 invested it was a good deal. I just opened the box and wanted to set it up but guess what! Doesn t turn on  doesn t charge  doesn t do anything. I tried numerous outlets thinking that was the problem but nope. Just a very expensive brick. Terrible quality control. My first ACER lasted a little over a year before it died. I saved up and purchased this ACER and it is pretty much DOA. The manufacturer wanted me to ship for up to 10 business days. Don t have time for that so returned through Amazon. Done with this brand. It doesn t turn on at all. LED indicators not lighting up even when plugged in. Already called tech support. Didn t help at all  decided to just return it. I saved up for this laptop for a long time  and I received it broken  it will not charge no matter what I try. I ve read other comments like this and I m extremely disappointed in the similar reviews. I ve returned it and I m waiting for a refund. This straight up didn t turn on. Pissed off. Basically Spent 800$ on a piece of metal and plastic. Does not power on. No charging indicator light. Does not charge. Doesn t power on while plugged in. Arrived DOA. Refunding. I purchased this as a Christmas gift but it would not turn on  even after attempting to charge overnight. I was sent a replacement  which would arrive after Christmas. I was extremely disappointed to say the least. Luckily  the replacement works. I got sent not one  but TWO laptops back to back that did not work. Save yourself the trouble  buy elsewhere. Horrible product. You must firmly press the adapter to the back. It looks like it s plugged in but it probably isn t. Keep pushing against the back of the laptop until you feel a click. Failure to do so will result in the laptop not powering on. Great portable pc  battery doesn t really last but it s basically a gaming pc whenever it s plugged in and running the rtx I can run destiny 2  apex  cs:go  split gate  etc. with very little lag. My only other complaint besides the battery is the storage space on it  if your getting this laptop I d recommend investing in a couple terabytes of external space  and a mouse cause the pad on the laptop is kind of in an awkward spot if your trying too use wasd controls but all that aside  it s a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice budget gaming laptop游뱇 Got this as a christmas gift for my kid and its a good thing I checked it first. I plug it in and notice the charging light doesn t activate. I try to power it up and it wont turn on. Hoping this gets resolved soon but even if I get a replacement it wont get here in time for the holiday. This review is going to be a 1 star pending a working replacement being sent. Works for gaming: CSGO  LOL  etc.. CPU is meh  hits 100% often Really good laptop for the price. Runs games at ultra graphics like a gem. The only reason I give it four stars is because they sent me a broken charger and I had to buy a new one. But they did refund me for the charger at least. Also the battery does die pretty quickly. Other than that it s a great purchase! I purchased this as a gift for my nephew and we did not open it until Christmas. The screen ended up being cracked and there customer care was well below satisfactory. They would not even work with me on an exchange or refund of any kind even after I sent pictures. I now have a 900 dollar laptop that does not work and a child without his Christmas present. Would never purchase from this company again. I recommend you Work on your customer satisfaction and service. I purchased the i5-10300H/RTX3050 version of this laptop.I was looking for a laptop with specific specs for under $1 000 and this checked all the boxes.I wanted a 15inch laptop with an amazing looking screen with and IPS panel running at 144Hz and a decent GPU that could utilize it.I ended up getting this laptop and adding a 500GB SSD additional storage and 8gb of Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz to bump this up to 16GB total. This ended up making the laptop much cheaper then buying one with that much ram and size of SSD in it on its own.The way the heat is distributed on this laptop (near the back by the screen) keeps my wrists from burning up like I have had with prior laptops.This thing has been able to run every game I play with at least 60fps on ultra settings.New world ultra settings - around 60-80fpsFF14 ultra settings - around 100 fps tbd the areaCall of duty medium settings - around 120 (did this on purpose to take advantage of the higher refresh rate)Smite Ultra settings - 80+ fpsThis laptop is hands down the best bang for your buck. If you are really looking for a higher end laptop then your going to be spending between the $1500-2000 mark. If you are trying to keep it under $1000 this was the best performance I was able to find for the price. I m in love with this laptop. I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it  i ll say it. This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY. It doesn t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds  and that s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too  it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly  loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops  but if you re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics  you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it  i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet  and it doesn t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up  but i don t plan on using it portably so I can t speak to that. This was worth every penny  and I m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price. I don t see how it gets any better than this for little ol  me The unit arrived dead. Plugged in the AC adapter firmly  checked cords  (we had a second AC adapter of the same specs). Power lights never lit up and the unit would not turn on.I ordered a second one. It just arrived and it game dead. I have to send this one back now too. Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in. Looks like a nice expensive paperweight. The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box. Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around. After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptop.Decided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra $100 after the price went up. Customer service was not accommodating in the least. The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time. Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again. que bruto pongale 0... recibi la laptop hace un par de dias y me asuste mucho  porque no encendia  ni cargaba ni encendia ninguna luz.. la deje toda la noche conectada pensando que podia haber venido descargada de bateria  pero nada.. al dia siguiente ya estaba a punto de contactar a soporte para enviarla a garantia  y me puse a leer el manual. cuya instruccion decia  al conectar el cargador asegurese de empujarlo hasta escuchar un click...ahi estaba el fallo. despues de conectarlo correctamente  encendio de una y hasta ahora vade maravillas.. I anticipate your questions - was the AC adapter plugged in correctly  was the outlet working? I checked both several times  all fine  just no response from the battery charge light  no lights whatsoever  no charge  no start.This is directly after unboxing  btw  so it was incredibly disappointing to be shipped a 750 dollar paperweight. I am in the process of getting my refund  and will never purchase an ACER again. Good laptop  this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it s @2933 and you should be okay. I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance @ 2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably. You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit. For games like WoW open world 89-144 fps out questing. PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with medium/high settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit. But is great at 1080p seeing it s a smaller screen resolution @ 1080p looks amazing. color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well. I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does. Honestly I think it s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version. The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games. but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss. I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth. You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 2.5 sata drive slot as well. I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4. I can t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700$ range that only runs on integrated graphics it s just not worth the money. Like a moth to a flame I was mesmerized by the value and great review ratings and I ignored the fact that there are at least SIX REVIEWS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS saying their machine (like mine) wouldn t even turn on!! Most stores would recognize this as a problem but Amazon shamefully just keeps selling this junk. This was in my house 3 hours before I got my money back along with arrangements for them to pick up the craptop at my door to return it. I will find another (non Acer) laptop  and I will buy it from somewhere other than Amazon. There has to be a price to pay for knowingly selling defective products.EDIT: Just want to address the 랓ou have to press the charger plug in extra hard comments from other reviews. Imagine you buy a brand new car and the dealer tells you that you need to use extra force when you close your door otherwise it will stay open and the car won t run. Are you going to be ok with that? Not me. And even if that s the issue  why didn t support know it when I talked to them? Also why is the battery at zero % therefore requiring the charger to power up? My replacement MSI worked perfectly right out of the box. I love this laptop  I push my laptop pretty hard  I use Blender  Daz3d and a few other software s for 3d modeling and rendering. this laptop can handle it pretty well. with blender cycles I could do optiX gpu rendering. in Daz Studio I was able to get a decent render using Nivdia iray with pretty good real time feed back. for games I was able to play Planetside 2 at a pretty good resolution at a good frame rate probably not like 120 fps on ulta high but it didnt dip below 30. with two m.2 drives on the bottom and a full ssd slot as well (cable is included so if you buy second hand watch out) I was able to get good storage. ram is upgradeable to 32 gbs which in the end is a pretty strong work horse. upgrading it was a bit scary as its not under the keyboard you have to take the bottom off and use a thin of plastic guitar pick or ifixit to open it up. go onto YouTube to watch a break down  its not to hard to upgrade. batter life is not great but you could tailor it by having it turn off lights and lower screen brightness. built in Bluetooth and full ethernet port 2 usb 3 ports and one usb c. which brings me to my con and that is very little vr support. I played vr games on a even older graphic card than this  and yet this RTX 3050 has no display port or a fast enough usb c to support an adapter. I cant say about the quest but I have a rift s and it will not work on this laptop. if you are looking for a mid workstation laptop this might fill the bill  if you are looking to get this for an artist going into school this one would be a good deal with the dedicated gpu this will extend the life of this computer to be able to handle most 3d and 2d applications.Pros:great power for the costhas some room for upgradesok for 3d workok for gamingCons:limited VR Supportbattery life is kind of short When I opened the laptop and plugged it in there was absolutely no activity  charging light did not turn on and laptop had no precharge. After a panicky hour of trying to figure out what s wrong with my brand new very expensive laptop  and realizing how many one star reviews were here for this exact issue  I cannot stress this enough  SHOVE THE CHARGER IN. It is VERY SNUG and you really REALLY have to push it hard. There is a very significant click of the charger going in  and as soon as it did everything was fine. Haven t used it yet  but wanted to update  as I now understand what all the one star reviews about this laptop being DOA are really about. Happy gaming! My son ask for this as a gift   we re in different countries  bought it and send to him only to know the part font fit . Don t buy 4m this site 79 processes and 41% of the ram out of the box. Not going to be doing much gaming with this mess. This is amazing quality for the price. I am able to play any game I want at the highest speeds and metrics. I haven t used the touch screen  but anticipate it would work just as well as everything else. Very glad I went with this computer. The laptop came dead on arrival. No power and the charging indicator light also would NOT turn on. The charger is working because I tested it on my other laptop. Laptop itself is dead. I m generally very pleased by this laptop but there are a few issues worth mentioning:- The trackpad is weirdly offset to the left for some reason instead of being in the center of the frame. This means that whenever I have my left hand on WASD  the base of my thumb rests on the corner of the trackpad which then slightly adjusts the mouse whenever I have to press space or alt. I don t play any games that would require this degree of precise aiming (like FPS  because I suck at them) but I imagine it would be infuriating if I did.- When I m alt-tabbing from a graphics-intensive game like dark souls 3 to a different program  the screen flashes black for a second. Not really a major issue but it was slightly worrying at first.Aside from that  performance is great  can t really speak to the battery life since I ve yet to use it while unplugged  but it s a powerful machine and I haven t had any issues with performance. I have had the computer for a little over 2 months. I m a mom so I don t get to use it as often as I would like. However it runs my games smoothly even with mods added. Loads content incredibly fast compared to my 4 year old computer. I believe we ll be purchasing another one shortly for my husband as his computer is nearing the end of its life. I would recommend this computer for sure. Had the opportunity to grab this Nitro 5 10300H/3050 for $699. The 4GB vram on the RTX3050 is a bummer but it s a brand new Ampere GPU with plenty of power for max 1080p gaming. The 10th gen i5 CPU is a small beast. A 1080p/144hz screen with nice brightness. With some little tweaks you can undervolt the CPU and overclock the GPU  upgrade the RAM to 16GB at least and you can squeeze a lot of more performance from this budget gaming laptop. Very happy with this purchase. I m sorry to say  but I am so disappointed. They don t make things like they used to.After having this laptop for some time I ve noticed some weird artifacting on the LCD/SCREEN.So  to explain  with night mode on or off you can see these rapidly moving lines that go through only certain colors like greys and blue s. This is unacceptable. It s very noticeable once you see it  and nothing software wise fixes it  so it s definitely a hardware problem.I painfully had to make the decision to return this and I m very upset. Need to push power cord until click heard! I thought I got a dead laptop until I read a review in Spanish that pointed out that the power cord that plugs in to the back of the laptop needs to go in until an audible click is heard. My son could not wait for this computer. He uses it every day and loves it  Says it is the best and so happy. His friend recommended this to him who know everything about computers- probably can build his own. My son loves all things technical so I trust him and says - get it ! Never once complained about it! He would say something the first day- not a peep ! This laptop is 100% worth the money. I did a lot of research into many many different laptops  specifically in the $600-$900 range  and this was the one I went with. And I m very glad I did. I bought it mainly for gaming and it works like a charm. Just some examples: 150+ FPS on Fortnite with high performance graphics  250+ FPS on Rocket League with high performance graphics  300+ FPS on Minecraft (default 랁ancy graphics)  200+ FPS on Forza Horizon with high graphics. I ve had absolutely no problems with it as far as gaming goes  and it works great for any daily work you may want to use it for. Note that I did add an extra 8gb of crucial ram into the open slot  which does improve performance. The only slight issue it has is that the fans can be a bit loud for more intensive games or programs. However  that s the case for many budget gaming laptops. Some good headphones will do the trick if it gets to be a problem. But like I said  this laptop is exactly what I was looking for and if you re looking for a good gaming laptop in the $800 price range  this is it. This is the first item I have ever returned from Amazon  as you have probably seen from other reviews  a common issue is the laptop will arrive simply not turning on or charging. I was one of those people that ignored technical issues such as these because they have never happened to me. That being said: I would be careful with this one  it is packaged so loosely that it very likely bounced around during its shipping and knocked something important  when it arrived sure enough  didn t indicate a charge  simply did not turn on. I would save your money  and get a gaming laptop from your local Best Buy instead. Depending on what you re after  maybe even a prebuilt from your local Best Buy  or perhaps a more reputable website to order from. Buyer beware. Laptop arrived today  box was not damaged. Unboxed it  plugged in the charger  pressed the power button and nothing. Plug works and has other devices plugged in.Gaming laptop for <900$ seemed to good to be true... and it was. bought for around 640 $ on black friday  what a dealthe laptop came and didnwt work! I was so worried. turns out  it was just the charger  and after replacing it works greatthe main thing I have to say isn t aabout the laptop but about amazon..they were so kind and proffesional with their help. the momentit turns out to be a problem with the charger they ffer a full discount for the defective charger. no trouble at all. I took more time writing this review than explaining the problem and getting help from them. if you want to buy latop from amazom I highly recommend it - and in Israel especially - much better service than the local companies and MUCH cheaper.now for the latop itself:it is a capable laptop. nothing to fancy or heavy ( i bought the 1 5 10300H version with RTX 3050 )PRO:price  hardwareCONS:the screen is weird. it hurts my eyes sometimes  and even thogh it is configured to 144 HZ  something doesn t add up. not feel right (checked several times  it is configured to 144 HZ)other than that:keyboard fels cheap  and the cover is a cheap plasticthere was also the issues with the charger I saidoverall  for the price  I think it was a great choice. for people who want a gaming beast or even just high quality laptop - this is not the place. but if you want a capable cheap laptop I thinkfor the price it is quite a fair bargain I wish I could give this 5 stars...Dead on Arrival. Returned 1 hour after opening. Unlucky I guess.That said  it s a nice build and the weight/form factor surprised me.I have an Acer chromebook  so I do trust them for quality. The return process is simple:just print label and drop it off at a UPS store. Good luck to everyone! So far the product has worked well however the power adaptor needs to be inserted and pushed all the way in and flush with the back of the laptop. The images in the user manual are not accurate and thus can make the initial set up confusing . Before you return it please see if your ac adapter is pushed in all the way  May help!@Acer  Please update your set up manual. All it is a rev change with a new picture and release . This should reduce your calls about this issue. My daughter order this gaming laptop on Thanks giving  I was happy but my happiness goes in drain  after plugin no lights laptop never work DOA (dead on arrival). I have told I cant reorder it because deal is 01 per customer nor I will get replacement  no other options except return. It s been a few weeks  the machine has the following issues;- Runs extremely hot during games  performance will still drop to sub ten FPS or hang completely. Alt-tabbing borderline lags out/crashes the machine.- USB ports on the left side fail to detect any and all new hardware  rendering the machine useless without a USB dock.- Sound coming out of the speakers is almost impossible to hear  so good luck watching videos/movies/etc. without headphones.The only good thing about this is the battery life  but since I spend most of my time with my machine plugged in because there s no way I ll be able to game on battery due to the performance drop battery life is useless to me.This is a very weak machine. Get an Alienware or MSI if you want a higher quality product. I ve seen Dell and HP laptops sell for $200 that can do more than this joke of a machine can. If you want barebones that MIGHT be able to run some games? Sure. Purchase at your own risk  though - as USB failures seem to be a common ACER problem. Great value for a baseline gaming laptop. Added a 1tb storage M2  and dual rank memory. FPS in Desriny2 went from 60ish to 90ish on average with less dipping. Using Nvidia optimized settings and video to only use the graphics card.I have it sitting on an angled base to raise the screen and for better airflow. Running the cooling in auto. BIOS does not support XMP  and I not sure it is using the dual rank config but it runs as expected. the picture of the box is how it arrived  no paddingreally. I love the UHD larger 17  screen! I bought this for business  so I knew I would need a gaming computer because it can handle large file sizes  high-resolution vids that I want to do for business. The large memory for viewing and building complex sites can slow down a computer  but with the high memory and storage and the operating system on an SSD drive  nothing slows down this beast. My son just bought an ACER; there seems to be a lot of value for the money compared to other brands. I purchased the i5-10300H/RTX3050 version of this laptop.I was looking for a laptop with specific specs for under $1 000 and this checked all the boxes.I wanted a 15inch laptop with an amazing looking screen with and IPS panel running at 144Hz and a decent GPU that could utilize it.I ended up getting this laptop and adding a 500GB SSD additional storage and 8gb of Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz to bump this up to 16GB total. This ended up making the laptop much cheaper then buying one with that much ram and size of SSD in it on its own.The way the heat is distributed on this laptop (near the back by the screen) keeps my wrists from burning up like I have had with prior laptops.This thing has been able to run every game I play with at least 60fps on ultra settings.New world ultra settings - around 60-80fpsFF14 ultra settings - around 100 fps tbd the areaCall of duty medium settings - around 120 (did this on purpose to take advantage of the higher refresh rate)Smite Ultra settings - 80+ fpsThis laptop is hands down the best bang for your buck. If you are really looking for a higher end laptop then your going to be spending between the $1500-2000 mark. If you are trying to keep it under $1000 this was the best performance I was able to find for the price. I m in love with this laptop. I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it  i ll say it. This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY. It doesn t miss a single beat. Loads in less than 30 seconds  and that s only with 8 gb of RAM. The screen quality is so nice too  it looks like it has an overlay almost. It starts up quickly  loads web pages super fast. I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even. I don t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops  but if you re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics  you will be BLOWN AWAY. The laptop is super light and thin. The keyboard has a nice feel to it  i like the back light but i wish you could change the color. I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet  and it doesn t heat up that much at all. It does slow down a little without being hooked up  but i don t plan on using it portably so I can t speak to that. This was worth every penny  and I m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price. I don t see how it gets any better than this for little ol  me The unit arrived dead. Plugged in the AC adapter firmly  checked cords  (we had a second AC adapter of the same specs). Power lights never lit up and the unit would not turn on.I ordered a second one. It just arrived and it game dead. I have to send this one back now too. Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in. Looks like a nice expensive paperweight. The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box. Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around. After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptop.Decided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra $100 after the price went up. Customer service was not accommodating in the least. The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time. Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again. que bruto pongale 0... recibi la laptop hace un par de dias y me asuste mucho  porque no encendia  ni cargaba ni encendia ninguna luz.. la deje toda la noche conectada pensando que podia haber venido descargada de bateria  pero nada.. al dia siguiente ya estaba a punto de contactar a soporte para enviarla a garantia  y me puse a leer el manual. cuya instruccion decia  al conectar el cargador asegurese de empujarlo hasta escuchar un click...ahi estaba el fallo. despues de conectarlo correctamente  encendio de una y hasta ahora vade maravillas.. I anticipate your questions - was the AC adapter plugged in correctly  was the outlet working? I checked both several times  all fine  just no response from the battery charge light  no lights whatsoever  no charge  no start.This is directly after unboxing  btw  so it was incredibly disappointing to be shipped a 750 dollar paperweight. I am in the process of getting my refund  and will never purchase an ACER again.

Haven t used it yet  but wanted to update  as I now understand what all the one star reviews about this laptop being DOA are really about. Happy gaming! Great for the price! The only thing that needs improvement is the sound quality.. doesn t get loud at all and very low quality speakers overall. Unit came in broken. Won t power on. Bought this computer and was sent one that was dead on arrival. Filed a complaint and requested a new one  same thing dead on arrival. Terrible quality control  would love to write an actual review for the product but it s been over a month and I still have yet to get sent a laptop that turns on. Battery when gaming is an hour tops. This is a nice laptop with good keyboard and screen but Battery life when gaming really sucks.If plugged in it has good performance for a 3050 laptop. Supposed to be a gift for my gf. Got 1 and didnt power up. Got a replacement. SAME ISSUE. QC is awful on this produce Would not turn on. I plugged in and no charging lights either. Tried multiple plugs on house and push power button many times as well my daughter was so disappointed was her Christmas gift. This laptop arrived dead. Multiple reviews have stated their laptop arrived dead as well. Don t waste your time with this. I tried charging through 3 different outlets and still nothing. Returning and refunding. Tech support was very helpful in making my return and refund. Again- do not waste your time with this Acer Nitro 5 laptop. It should be taken off the Amazon site as a whole. This computer can handle everything you throw at it  I got the RTX 3050 version for 800+  but I highly recommend that you upgrade the devices RAM  to get the best out of the Graphics Card. I will be doing that very soon  myself. You can also upgrade the SSD with two of them including a hard drive as well  I highly recommend you guys buy this computer it is totally worth it  if you are interested in serious gaming. The cpu is 2.5ghz  but it has 4.5ghz turbo. So I am happy. It shows 4.2+ghz on task manager and I tested doom and got steady 120+hz. I upgraded with another 8gb ram and 1tb ssd for only about another $100 so for around $900 I am very happy with this purchase! The media could not be loaded. \\xa0Perfecta perfecta perfecta sin m치s que agragar  vivo en rep칰blica Dominicana y pens칠 que la pc seria muy mala opci칩n comprarla pero me facina todo lo de ella excelente As a gaming computer my son rates this 5 out of 5 for this price point. The laptop works well - runs smoothly. My son uses this laptop primarily for games. It has a great read and write speed when downloading games or files. The games run smoothly - modern warfare  etc. The hard drive space is good for the average person  but if you want to have multiple files and games you ll need an external drive. The biggest plus is the battery port in the back  which is way easier to use than the side ports a lot of laptops have. Overall this computer works well for the price ( less than $900). The only complaint is that the fan gets loud and gets hot if you do anything intensive  which is a issue most laptops unfortunately have. I am admittedly a little new to the pc gaming world  but this seems to pack a punch! The battery lasts incredibly long on a single charge so it s nice for taking to a friends house  or traveling. Even when off the charger the whole machine runs so quickly it feels instantaneous  no lag at all. I was extra impressed that you can have multiple tabs or windows running at the same time  and switch between what is minimized with no errors. Again  I am newer to this  so maybe I am na칦ve  but online games take a lot of processing power to run with no hitches and this seems to work perfectly.I personally like the red back light on the keys  but can look a little ominous when you re in the dark haha. The back light does go away once you stop typing for 30 seconds or so. The only other hitch is that the fans are loud. The are cooling down a machine that is working hard  so it makes sense  but I would recommending headphone of some kind to block that out. Great for this new gamer that uses it for regular email and work functions as well as online games! I was on the lookout for a new laptop for video editing. The big thing that attracted me to this model was the GeForce RTX 3050 video card.The configuration I ordered was a bit light on RAM and hard drive space  so I ended up upgrading to 32 GB of low latency RAM and adding an additional 256 GB SSD drive.The big win for me was the performance gains I got in video rendering. On my old machine  the rendering could take anywhere from 20-60 minutes  depending on video size. Generally  most rendering on this laptop takes less than 5 minutes! I can t even calculate how much time this new laptop has saved me.Rating 5 stars. Highly recommended. Great laptop for the price. Will run any game you throw at it with no problems. Some extremely demanding games will be limited to high settings instead of ultra because of the 4gb of VRAM. However if you re gaming on the laptop screen it s very hard to perceive any difference between medium/high and ultra settings because of the pixel density of a 1080p 15.6  display.I highly recommend adding more storage and another 8gb of RAM to get the most out of this laptop. If you re uncomfortable doing that then look for a model with more storage and 16gb of RAM from the manufacturer.For advanced users  I highly recommend changing the thermal paste to something better. 10-15C temperature drops can be had. Also leaving the power plan on  Balanced  and enabling coolboost in the Nitrosense application will help keep temperatures at acceptable levels.Pros:-Runs 99% of games smooth as silk. Unless you hit vram limit  you re looking at 60fps+ or above with high settings.-RTX 3050 has current gen tech like DLSS that will extend the life of the laptop.-Keyboard is a huge improvement over the last gen model.-Laptop overall is a sleeker  more streamlined design over the last gen model. Less wasted space  smaller bezels and weighs less.-Much better cooling solution than previous models. RTX 3050 never breaks 70C after changing thermal paste.-The display is nice. Deep blacks and vivid colors but with some drawbacks at this price point. 144hz is also an excellent addition.Cons:-Speakers are absolutely terrible.-Screen has absurd levels of backlight bleed.-The laptop runs HOT without changing the thermal paste. Even on Acer s  balanced  power plan the CPU was hitting upwards of 90C and throttling. After changing the paste it runs around 67-72C consistently while gaming.-10300H still has good enough performance for most games today but being a quad core it will soon struggle.Overall it s about what you would except from a laptop at this price point. I can see why some people will say it runs hot. It does need some slight tweaking to get the most from it and not have it melt in your lap. It s a solid performer though. I ve tried games like Escape From Tarkov  Red Dead Redemption 2  Monster Hunter World  Halo Infinite  and Forza Horizon 5. Haven t had a single issue. Normally I game on my 3700X/2070S desktop but this is a very acceptable compromise for more portable gaming. The lap top is working as expected  with 800 USD you were able to get a 3050 GPU  which is good for most light duty game like CS go  DOTA2  etc. Which is good enough for me. Unlike those ultra book  this one has slot RAM and can be upgrade to like 32GB and another stat HDD slot  but they don t include cable and socket. I believe you d have to do some research how to solid one. It looks like a good deal for light gamer. This lap top is junk do not buy. I ve had this nitro 5 for 1 year and the mother board is toast. Tried to contact acer and they told me it was out of warranty. This lap top maybe had a weeks worth of use and it s already junk. Don t go cheap buy American Never ever settle for an i5 cpu especially in a laptop. It seems like a good deal but it s not every gaming laptop should at least have an i7 if they want it to be worth buying. L 1: It sound like a 747 getting ready to take off whenever you even think about opening anything.2: Always freezes after 2 or so minutes into a game and will either stay this way until you shut it off or just shut off and require a battery reset.3: Battery resets are apparently a part in owning this thing considering I have to do it after like 2 minutes into a game. It s alright  runs current games on medium settings. The storage HDD on mine died after just over a year For a laptop this small and lightweight  I m surprised at the performance it carries. What an incredible piece of tech! Bad experience The battery life isn t great but other than that it s great Make sure that you push the charger cord in the back of the computer until you hear a click or it won t charge. I dislike the battery they need to fix it that s all You can upgrade some of the internal components for a better experience. Pretty cheap in terms of laptops didn t charge or turn on at all Everything is according to the seller  but you have to forcefully push the power adapter all the way in. Buena compra  su relacion precio/producto es 4/5 It s for my son  he is a beginner developer and avid gamer  this laptop meets his needs 100%. This computer is awesome! Only issue is low storage space but the computer came with an adaptor chord! Charger didn t work so i couldn t even start up the laptop. Might not happen to you  person reading this but it will be annoying if it does. grate speed fantastic graphics Save yourself the time and buy something else. I thought I d try my luck against the reviews. Sadly they proved to be correct. Don t buy. The AC port did not fit. Great entry level gaming pc It runs great able to run some big games at a good fps but storage and ram is a bit on the low side other than that if it new to PC and don t know what to get this is ur best choice. My husband and I got this for his big Christmas present. He loves it and has been on it since before Christmas everyday I asked him how does he like it and he says it runs great for the games he plays. Not sure what games but they cost money lol It slowed down tremendously after one week of use  and I only downloaded ONE game It s a computer So on Christmas morning I thought it was DOA. However  you really have to push in the power cord into the back of it computer. There is a noticeable click. If you do not hear the click then it will not charge. This laptop is great for gaming. I ve had it for about 5 months now and have no complaints. Very little lag..sometime it does but it s not the laptop. Decent laptop for gaming Runs everything at 144+ Fps on external screen. (I m talking GTA on high settings) I ve been in the pro scene of gaming on Xbox and this delivers for comp gameplay. Siege 200+ Fps. Fortnite 300+Fps. GTA 144+ Fps. Warzone 100+ Fps. Valorant 400+Fps. Runs VR great aswell. This is a great pickup for gaming but the storage drive is a little lacking at 256 gigs. I play rdr2  Fortnite  csgo  halo infinite  etc. just fine at regular settings  haven t tried to push it too much settings wise but I m fine with the regular settings on the games and they run good  no lag. The fan can be loud but I wear headphones and after a little bit you barely notice it. Ordered 2 of these for my boys for Christmas just to open them up and find that both were dead and no matter what I did  they would not charge. Save your money. Just like many I had issues with the charging cord.but I kept reading reviews and found someone who said to push until it snaps into the laptop.and it worked! I ve never had a laptop that plugged in that hard but it is perfect for my gaming son! He loves it. If you re looking for something that can play most modern AAA titles at medium or low  this is IT. Slap another 8gb of ram and some storage in this thing (under $140) and its an amazing budget laptop for the price! It also includes a free month of game pass and an upgrade to win 11. It s awesome. I love it! Got this a week ago and can I say  I didn t expect the RTX 3050 in here to be this good (It has a low TDP). I suggest getting more storage and ram. It will vastly improve your experience with the machine ZERO STARS - They delivered the wrong laptop! I ordered the Acer Nitro and got a Lenovo Chromebook... WTF Acer produces cheapest computers. The low price comes from cheap chips. Still worth to buy if want to save money. Me and my husband decided to get this laptop as he needed a more powerful PC for his old Macbook used for web development and programming and I wanted to have something that we could use to game with on the go. None of us have bought a new laptop in many many years  let alone a gaming laptop vs a business oriented laptop or budget/lightweight laptop. This seemed like a great compromise between new tech/hardware  easily upgradable in terms of ram  and something that wasn t super super flashy or expensive. We ve never had a PC with some of this hardware on it but we both were familiar with it in any case. We both spent the last two months with it to get an idea of the feel for this laptop in different use cases and so on.I checked and the machine had the latest bios and firmware  which was a great sign. I decided to run some basic benchmarks and get a feel for it in Windows before wiping it and putting Linux on it. One thing I ran into right off the bat was that I wasn t used to the laptop cable being a bit confusing to use. It will look like it s in all the way but you usually have to push in a little bit more. It s sturdy in both cases but it s confusing as it can seem sturdily in but you always have to push it in a bit more. When I first was using the laptop I had a bit of a heart attack thinking it was DOA but it s just that you need to push the adapter alll the way in. I ve never had a newer gaming laptop before so I was surprised the power brick is 180w!! It s not super bulky or anything for its power output but keep it in mind if you have 랏niversal laptop adapters or want to get a new one  that a 90w may work for every day use but you may run down on gaming/etc. The screen is nice and bright  an IPS screen  but there was something I just couldn t put my finger on  that made it seem like something was 랇acking for a gaming PC screen. It wasn t bad at all but I ve had really nice monitors and something just felt a little off. My husband on the other hand thought the the 144 Hz display was very crisp and great  other than being a bit dim on BIOS and boot  but then picking up to be crisp and he appreciated the full/true HD on this model. He s more of the design guy so I ll defer to that :)Here are some of the stats I got from running a few things on Windows and checking the fan app Nitrosense: The Geekbench CPU test in terms of temp was around 58-61 and had short peaks at 72-69 towards the end peak at max fan while watching with Nitrosense. These are more than reasonable numbers for CPU temps. As an aside  I would have preferred that this had an AMD chip versus the fiasco that is Intel s 10th gen mobile chip on outdated 14nm architecture but for our purposes it s just an annoyance vs anything that would affect performance. Geekbench gave a score of 1004 single core 2869 multi core  which is quite a bit lower than expected with that CPU so maybe I take the previous statement back  though  hah. I m cheap so I used 3dmark11  here are the results for that: Graphics score 17531  Physics core 7811  Combined score 8038After all that I decided to nuke Windows and to put Manjaro Linux on it. This is the one area I ran into an issue with and am actually deducting a star just for this. I got it to work in the end but I m really shocked that Acer would make things this user unfriendly given what I knew of them as a company up until now and am worried this trend will continue. There are a couple of basic annoying things about the bios that you ll have to enable for Linux. First off a bunch of stuff is grayed out unless you set a bios password which is infuriating to me. Set a junk bios password and then make sure to enable f12 boot option and disable fast boot just in case any issues crop up - I didn t run into them but after Googling around I didn t want to take any chances and it was probably smart to be prepared after the second nightmare I ran into뵈nyway  if you try to install any form of Linux  you ll get a message that there s no hard drive available. Why? Well  this laptop comes with one NVME drive with an M.2 storage chip. There s some terrible secret bios setting on by default which makes this drive s interface Intel Rapid Storage or RST only  which is some horrible proprietary Intel thing where supposedly you can make use of RAM to get more performance  I don t know  but in any case with this enabled there is no backwards compatibility on a standard ACHI interface. I didn t see the option in bios and was devastated that I may just have to install a standard SSD. However  it turns out there is a 랍ecret option in bios. You have to press Ctrl + S in the main screen  and then go a tab over and a secret option to change the hard drive mode from RST to ACHI is there. Once you change that everything is fine but there should be no secret bios option and I am terrified that upon updating bios this will be removed and that I ll forget the lame password I had to put JUST to change some simple options. The most awful bios I ve seen recently and it s a really bad look for Acer.A couple of weeks of using it and we decided to upgrade to 32GB of ram which is one of the main reasons we got this model. The laptop begins with one stick with 8 GB and gives you an extra slot  so if you want to upgrade from 8 GB it s really nice that you don t have to buy a whole new set of RAM  you can just buy another 8 GB stick or add whatever you might already have.The laptop is considerably faster than my husband s Macbook 2015 when running my development environment and build tools. He runs development in a VirtualBox environment which is resource intensive but has no issues and everything runs fast. It runs a node.js and nginx server in that environment  plus node.js build scripts which are also resource intensive but has no issues with these either.We also have no issues running games on Steam/Wine with Linux although we are not hardcore gamers we tried some MMOs we liked versus the indie games we usually do which don t need this kind of power  and were able to put them at max setting and they looked beautiful. Still have to break in the gaming stuff a bit more but no issues with Wine and the video card on linux at all  I can recommend Linux gaming for all  in some cases the games run faster and better!The keyboard is backlit but has function keys to dim the backlight until it turns off  in case the light bothers you. There is also a function key to turn the screen on and off which is useful to do when I leave the laptop idling when I step away from it.Included are some pictures of the RAM install. The inside is very very nicely organized and extremely easy to navigate. There is also an extra HD slot as well as an extra slot for adding another M.2 storage chip. The laptop comes with one M.2 chip already.When we start to do resource intensive tasks the fans start to get a bit noisy but nothing out of the ordinary. The fans are doing a good job because I have not noticed any lag or slowing down even when they re working furiously. We did notice one time where the laptop flashed the caps lock key after shutting down and wouldn t boot immediately but booted again later - we assumed maybe it had overheated a bit and it turns out that was the case (contacted Acer as well and they confirmed it). Only happened once so glad actually the thermals were protecting themselves.Overall we re very happy with this laptop. It did turn out as being a great compromise between something that would have been too flashy and expensive but gave us a lot of power and especially the ability to upgrade for dev tasks and gaming while on the go. Other than the bios issue  nothing stood out to us as annoying or even really any cons. It feels really quite portable for a gaming laptop and although the style/form is obviously a gaming laptop it s subtle. It s a great value performance laptop that s easy to upgrade - but Acer  quit your BIOS shenanigans! *** UPDATE 8/13/2020 -- I updated drivers  and RTX 3050 is now running 58-65 FPS on Ultra  and 93-98 FPS on High settings. I must have needed an update  this is a legitimate gaming Laptop! ***I picked up the Acer Nitro 5 to play Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) remotely when I travel or take road trips with my wife. During my first few days of use  I was only getting about 30fps at 1080p at medium settings. Just as I made peace with this  I installed a driver update and a windows update  and I started to get the legitimate 60FPS (+/-5) that I was originally expecting.As a laptop  the Acer Nitro 5 is great. It loads fast  and put on an older version of Office 2013 that I own from the old Microsoft HUP (Home User Program) that let employees get a never-expiring license for $9.95 if their company owned it at work. For most desktop use  the PC is snappy and works as fast as my i5 Surface Book 4.As a gaming laptop  I m happy now that the a software update (I have no idea which one) brought me the performance I was expecting. The RTX 3050 can indeed pull 60 frames per second (fps) with Ultra on a game like Elder Scroll Online that was released in 2014 (7 years ago). At High settings  it even gets a respectable 93-98 FPS with tweaks to individual settings like shadow quality.I play most of the huge franchise games (Fallout  CyberPunk  Elder Scrolls  Far Cry  Witcher  Watch Dogs  Assasin s Creed  Crysis  Dead Island  Dying Light  Saints Row  The Crew  Need for Speed  Bioshock  Borderlands  etc). I have a RTX 3080 system hooked up to an 85in TV where I play 4k Gaming in the evenings  and I have a slightly older Dual GTX 1080 SLI desktop system in my office that I use for 2k/1440p gaming.I picked up ESO (Elders Scrolls Online) for the first time about 2 months ago  and I wanted to be able to login from the road for daily rewards and to play a few hours before going to bed.The 256Gb Hard Drive was large enough to hold the ridiculous 180Gb install for ESO  and the built in Bluetooth works perfectly with my 3rd party  Microsoft xbox One  style controller.I was initially disappointed when I blindly launched the game with default settings and was only getting 24-28FPS. I tried to get Geforce Experience to launch to recommend  Optimal Settings   but I could not get it to load. (Again  after some searching.... I learned that GForce Experience is buggy and nobody really uses it... I guess I ve just always been lucky). A week later  I was thrilled when I launched and started getting the frame rates I initially expected.As I attempted to understand the initial low frame rates  I went out to check the Passmark settings for RTX3050 on videocardbenchmark.net. That s where I discovered my error. I d thought an RTX 3050 would be in a similar class to my RTX 3080 which I use for 4k gaming. The RTX 3050 is a mobile card with a passmark score of about 9 286.For reference  the performance of the RTX 3050 mobile in this laptop is akin to an old GeForce GGTX 780 TI (9 165)  GTX 1060 (9 870)  Radeon Pro 5600m (10 484)  GTX 1060 TI mobile (10 176) or GTX 1070 Mobile (10 465).As it turns out  it CAN pull down decent frame rates at 1080p... (With the fans going rather high  but oh well!) I wouldn t put this to 2k or 4k gaming uses on an external monitor though. The RTX3050 Mobile s passmark score of 9 286 is nowhere near a GeForce RTX 3060 TI (19 755)  RTX 3070 (21 873)  or RTX 3080 (24 404). So  you have to be reasonable.Overall  I am happy with the laptop. The price was reasonable. The game play experience is smooth now that all my updates and patches are installed.As of my 3rd week of ownership (8/13/2021)  I m a happy camper! TL; DR: The Acer Nitro 5 AN515-55-53E5 Gaming Laptop is an entry-level gaming-capable computer. Its out-of-the-box specs are underwhelming  but some can be upgraded  like RAM and hard drive space. The RTX 3050 is the cheapest house in the fancy neighborhood. It s a solid starter GPU for current games  but temper your frame rate and detail expectations. The Comet Lake i5 CPU is capable  but can run hot. Get used to the fans. Don t pay more than MSRP  given you ll need to fork out some extra money on ram and another SSD to meet basic storage needs.Form & Build:The Nitro 5 is a big computer  but not so big that you couldn t put it in a backpack and take it with you to a friend s place. (Do people still have LAN parties? Good times) The heavily plastic build keeps the weight down  but contributes to some questionable points of quality. For instance  pressing on the top of the lid when closed  there s a lot of give. This can absorb impact if you drop it--feels like it could crack under the wrong force. The semi-gloss surfaces inside and out do pick up oils from the skin that are hard to get off and show as shiny spots.There are some good input options  with 3 standard USB ports and a USB C port. There s an ethernet port  too  as well as an HDMI output and a headphone/mic jack. The only port on the rear of the unit is the power jack  which is sort of awkwardly placed right in the middle  rather than off to the side. There is no Displayport output.The fan can get quite loud to keep the unit cool. The CPU heats up  especially when gaming. The bottom of the computer stays relatively cool  thanks to the fans and ventilation to the rear and sides  but parts of the keyboard can get pretty warm. You can monitor CPU and GPU temperatures in the NItro app. There s even a hotkey for it (top left of the number pad).Keyboard  Touchpad and Screen:The keyboard is well-sized. It s nice to have a full number pad. The keys have good travel; they re quiet and have solid feedback. Some of the keys are oddly sized/placed  like the right shift key  to make more room for the arrows and the number pad. The number pad has standard sized keys. The red backlighting can be adjusted for brightness  but not for color (unless there is some software controller that I haven t been able to find yet). It can t be changed in the Lenovo Vantage or Nitro app. The texture of the keys feels slightly rubberized  but smooth without being slippery. Trackpad is smooth and responsive. It s a decent size  but I d be comfortable with something a little larger. You ll probably be using a mouse for gaming anyway.The screen is okay. I like that it is slightly elevated with a larger bezel to the bottom--this makes it feel a little larger than it is and gives a better viewing angle. The matte finish is good for reducing glare. However  visually  it s a bit washed out. Blacks and whites have a slight grayness to them and the screen never seems quite as bright as it could be. Make good use of that HDMI output and hook up to your favorite full-sized monitor.Performance:Gaming performance on the Nitro 5 is good enough for a lot of games. If you re looking for a decent laptop to play League of Legends  WoW or Final Fantasy 14 with your friends  this one will definitely work. If you want to dominate in League  destroy your foes in PVP or need super high frame rates and detail for streaming you might want to invest in something with higher specs  even with the upgradeability of this PC.The factory SSD works really well. Games and programs load fast  starting up Windows after sleep/hibernate/shutdown is a breeze. The Nvidia Experience app will automatically optimize game settings based on your hardware  or you can manually tweak certain things based on your play style  which is really great. You can monitor resource use and temperatures using the Nitro app.My current games of choice are World of Warcraft Shadowlands (2020) and Code Vein (2019). I ve had to turn detail down a bit in both games for the sake of framerate  but they both still run very well. In WoW  I m at medium-high custom settings (graphics slider is at 7  with some settings turned down a little lower  like spell effects  ground cover and water detail). I m getting 60-80 fps depending the number of other players in an area. Code Vein is almost maxed out settings-wise. I turned down distance-detail and turned off ray tracing to improve framerates and responsiveness.Download speeds are pretty impressive. A lot can depend on client-side factors (battle.net has much slower download speeds than Steam  for instance)  but on Steam  I ve been averaging 50mbs or about 3-4 GB/min.  which is nothing to sneeze at. Glad I installed another hard drive to install those games on!Upgrading:You only get 8GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD on this computer out of the box. These are the most lackluster specs but  these are also the things you can upgrade. I successfully doubled my usable hard drive space by adding a cheap 240GB 2.5in SATA SSD into the open bay. There is also an OPEN RAM slot. You can slip an 8GB stick right into that open slot to double the ram or replace the ram and add more with 2x16 for a max of 32GB  which should speed up your overall performance quite a bit  especially if you do a lot of multitasking. These are  of course  going to be additional expenses  but not all laptops these days allow for this kind of upgradeability and the flexibility to make changes later as you get a feel for what your needs are. Hardware for adding a 2.5in drive is included in the box with the laptop  and there are step-by-step instructions for adding a new hard drive and RAM on the ACER support website that were very helpful. They did not  however  include the software stuff you ll need to know if you ve never added a hard drive before. After installing the new drive  search for how to get Windows to recognize the new hard drive. You ll need to go into the system manager to initialize  format and assign a letter to your new drive before you can use it. I spent several weeks with this laptop before sitting down to review it. My conclusions are that for the price-point asked for it  which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place  it s well worth the money. The graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines I have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one. For me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors. My most demanding games performed without glitches  sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality. Speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about. The screen here provides crisp  clear images  another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged. Conversely  however  the sound card could be better. This card can deliver uneven sound-effects when gaming  though it s fine for watching movies or streaming. RAM can be upgraded though I see no need to do so at this point. The casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops  so much so that I d feel comfortable using it in a business setting; something I would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they re designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment. This is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment  essential for a good gaming experience and something I would want anyway from any computer. My bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under $900 as of this writing in late July 2021. I d definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price. In the  almost touching four figures  range  there are a lot of surprisingly good gaming laptops coming onto the market from different manufacturers. Assuming each one was available  you d be spoiled for choice this summer. Decent processors  nice midrange RTX GPU s  and at least a certain degree of expandability should be expected.Acer s Nitro 5 is... well  not great. Personally  when I think Acer  I think  budget . And there s nothing wrong with budget systems and components. I m quick to recommend Acer to people on a tight budget who are looking for entry-level laptops. Their stuff isn t top-tier  but is usually fine for what you pay. Few of us have infinite dollars to spend on computers. Though Acer tends to make their products *feel* like they re not quite as good as everything else  and the Nitro 5 is no exception here.Case in point: at the time of this writing  another hundred bucks or so gets you the\\xa0 Lenovo Legion 5 . And for that hundred dollars  you get build quality that makes the Nitro feel kind of flimsy  you get a processor that absolutely trounces the comparatively anemic i5 10300H  twice the RAM  twice the storage space  an ARGB keyboard  and a faster refresh rate on the display.All that  for a hundred bucks. Give or take.So  is that a testament to Lenovo giving you an incredible value  or Acer not being up to par? Yes.Having both systems side-by-side  it highlights so many places where Acer could have delivered  but cheaped out. When you delve into what you re getting with the Nitro 5  everything about it feels like you took the cheapest thing on the shelf. From the very beginning  you need to dedicate nearly an hour out of the box just for Windows updates that Acer didn t add to their shipping image. And not because of a slow connection (I was hitting in the neighborhood of 800 megabits over 802.11ax) but you can feel how constricted the system really is with that i5 and only 8 gigs to work with.Once you ve got your Windows updates set  you have to navigate the sea of bloatware that Acer loaded the Nitro 5 up with. No  I don t want Express VPN. No  I don t want Dropbox. No  I don t want your weird app store. No  I don t want your... whatever this password manager thing is that I ve never heard of. No  I don t want... And it hits you that while you d wading through all of this junk  Acer thought it would be good to put their system update software other than in the Acer folder. It s kind of a head scratcher.All the while  the bottom of the laptop gets scorching hot. Yeah  a gaming laptop without a great vapor chamber is going to get toasty  but again  it s one of those areas where Lenovo figured out how to make efficient heat pipes that make the Legion 5 bearable. Why didn t Acer?So I moved on. Let s get 3DMark and PCMark on here  and see how it compares. And even that produced a  Go home  Acer. You re drunk.  kind of emotion. Load up 3DMark  and it says  Hey  you ve got an i5  and I see this RTX 3050 over here...  and then it barfs at the end saying that it couldn t quite figure out what you have. I installed official GeForce drivers  uninstalled and reinstalled 3DMark  and still got the same  This isn t official because reasons.  message. But don t take my word for it. Check out the pictures I ve attached.So the results  while not  official  tell a pretty interesting story about what a hundred bucks more gets you. As you can see  these are the Acer Nitro 5 against the Lenovo Legion 5. While 3DMark is calling the GPU  Generic VGA   you can see for yourself that the specs are correct for a 3050 dGPU and are too high to be the iGPU from the i5. But they re also 1618 apart.For perspective s sake: the difference between the Nitro 5 and the Legion 5 is 100 points greater than the difference between the Legion 5 and my desktop Ryzen 9 5900X with an RTX 3080 GPU. And again  you can see that the dGPU is running at full frequency. Even if you re thinking  Oh  this dude is a total Lenovo shill  and the results don t have approved drivers  and I m an internet detective and blah  blah  blah...  look at the CPU scores. There s no CPU driver. And it isn t like Acer or Lenovo are like  Yeah  go hog wild with settings for undervolting and underclocking in our expansive BIOS features  on either system.In my review of the Legion 5  I took it apart and ran PC Mark  and dug deeper into it because I couldn t believe how much power you were getting for the price. But with the Nitro 5  I didn t see much point. The moment you try to slap more RAM into it  you re at the same price point. It would cost you more to bring just the RAM and NVMe drive to the same specs as the Legion 5  and you d still have a slower computer with a slower refresh rate  worse warranty  inferior build quality  middling keyboard  and terrible heat management. I m  late  to the game (pun intended) with my review as there are already a few very complete and competent ones before mine. I agree with just about everything there  so I ll just add a few of my own thoughts.I kinda like the fact that this came with a reasonable  yet perhaps slightly underwhelming  set of components to get you started. The fact that they included the cable and bracket for a 2.5  drive in the box is awesome. That says to me  Listen  we know you re gonna want more storage eventually. We didn t include it to keep the cost of entry down  but here s the parts you ll need to make it happen.  The bottom cover is easy to take off to get at the drives and RAM - which also could use an upgrade when you re ready. This is all appealing to me so Acer did good in this department.The laptop has a slight  cheap plastic  feel to it. But it s not so bad that you re afraid to move or use it. It s just not made from premium materials  but that doesn t mean it s not built well. The keyboard is a little mushy to type on  and I kinda wish they hadn t chosen to cram in the number pad on the side  because this makes the key spacing and arrangement a little uncomfortable. I know this is a gaming laptop  but sometimes one needs to type on it too. I found the red light to be a bit much in a dark room  but the brightness is adjustable so that s fine. The screen is passable. There s a pretty significant amount of backlight bleed on dark screens  but when playing a game that fills the screen with bright colors  it s more than fine. Speaking of the colors  they re not perfect but are good enough at this price  in my opinion. One cool thing that I haven t seen mentioned anywhere is that the cooling fans have red lights in them. These can be faintly seen from the rear vents when the ambient light is low enough. A nice touch that is relatively unseen  but cool to know it s there.As for performance  I tested it with Forza Horizon 4 - the only game I own currently  and it did fine. The automatic profile didn t have everything cranked up  but the game still looked beautiful to my eyes. There was no stuttering or tearing that I saw and it got 72 fps. The laptop handled all  regular  computing tasks with ease. The included combination of CPU  RAM and SSD all seem to work well together for an enjoyable computing experience. That being said  I did do a clean install of Windows 10 to get rid of the small amount of bloatware that came with it. It seemed to be a little less bogged down after that  but it honestly wasn t too bad to begin with.That s about all I ve got to say about it. Overall  I think it s a fine choice for the casual  budget-minded gamer. It comes equipped-enough to get you started and has room to be even better without breaking the bank all at once. Huge points for the RAM not being soldered - a current trend and big pet peeve of mine. And the rest of the system s not bad either. I know Acer is considered a  lesser  brand than some of the other big ones  but I think they did alright here! The Nitro series from Acer is their budget line of gaming laptops. Tucked away in this line are some hidden gems and very capable laptops able to handle your gaming needs. Is the Acer Nitro 5 up to task? Hopefully this full review will answer all your questions.If you re interested in benchmarks  I ve included a full set of pics for CB23  Timespy and CrystalDiskMark.WHAT YOU RECEIVE:Arriving in a classic  small form factor eco friendly beige box with very gamer themed artwork inside you will find:The Acer Nitro 5 laptopPower supply with cordCouple of small leaflets Direct Amazon support insert2.5  SSD/Hard drive installation cable and screwsSeveral stickers for the Acer game branding  Planet9 The laptop itself only weighs 4.75lbs and even with the adapter and power cord  the total weight is just shy of 6lbs total. It is the smallest competent gaming laptop I ve ever owned.MY SPECS:i5-10300H Intel Quad core (4 core / 8 thread) 14nm Cometlake CPUNvidia RTX 3050 (non-ti) 4GB GPU15.6  IPS 144hz display8GB DDR4 2933 memory singular module running in single channel modeWestern Digital SN530 256GB NVME SSDIntel AX201 WiFiPORTS:I love that the power connector is on the rear of the laptop. The right side has a USB-C 3.2  USB A 3.2 and an HDMI connector. The left side has 2x USB A 3.2  slimline thernet  headphone jack and a lock port.GAMING:My main game is World of Warcraft and I was able to get right in and play after setup. With its new overhauled engine  World of Warcraft:Shadowlands will give your CPU and GPU a fairly decent workout. Framerates weren t maxed but with details at Ultra 10 (max setting) and Raytracing set to max I was still netting very playable framerates ranging from 50-90. Checking with MSI Afterburner  my GPU was 99-100% utilized at all times while my CPU utilization was around 50% which means I was GPU bound.I ran a few gaming benchmarks too for comparison. Futuremark s Timespy netted 4798 which is right in line with the average score of 4800 for the RTX 3050 Mobile. This means the 3050 is ~13% faster than a desktop 1060 with all the added extras features of 3000 series RTX GPUs.BENCHMARKS AND THERMALS:While stress testing / benchmarking the CPU and GPU never overheated and fans didn t hit max. If you like  Acer includes a custom control center called Nitro Sense that will allow you to boost your cooling or manually turn fans to max for the ultimate in cooling. During gaming  I did not need headphones. The fans are most certainly there but nowhere near what I ve experienced with other gaming notebooks.I tested the CPU with Cinebench 23 and it never heat throttled achieving a very respectable score of 5592 multi and 1100 single with a max temp of 86 with fans at max and 93c with fans on auto.I tested the GPU with Timespy and Superposition and it never throttled with a max temp of 60cWhen gaming  both CPU and GPU are working and being cooled in tandem and temps for the CPU maxed at 85 and GPU at 78 after a few hours of gaming with fans not hitting max. The power supply definitely gets warm to the touch.BLOATWARE:I ve used a few Acer laptops before and the extra programs were not that bad but this time around that is not the case. The system felt slightly laggy and unresponsive versus as how a new install should feel. The system had so much installed and so much going on that checking how many programs were installed said 85. As a test  I did a clean install and updated everything and installed all the drivers and Nitro Sense and that dropped to 51. That means there were at least 34 extra programs/events installed.DISPLAY:This is easily the weakest point of the Acer Nitro. Yes it is a 144hz panel  but this panel is not the greatest. The Nitro series uses the Panda NCP004D. This panel has only 62% sRGB and 43% AdobeRGB coverage. It is quickly noticeable the color space is bad as the reds are a washed out deep orange and blues are pale. GTG response time is ~41ms. It actually has decent brightness and contrast with an acceptable black level  but the poor colors and especially bad response time will be unacceptable to some hardcore gamers. For most gamers  it will be a non issue. I was actually ok with the response times as I m not  hardcore   but it was the immediate lack of pop and washed out colors that caught my eye. My panel had a lot of backlighting ghosting in both bottom corners when dark. Most IPS panels have blacklighting and ghosting in at least one corner or more. It is just to what degree.SOUND:The speakers were surprisingly very respectable. You re not going to get some deep bass or amazing seperation  but they were more than passable when playing games or viewing videos / listening to music. They were easily able to outpace the fans when gaming.MEMORY AND STORAGE:8GB is not going to cut it anymore. While playing WoW and using MSI Afterburner to measure my usage  my system was using almost 7GB for gaming alone. The 8GB is upgrade-able as the system has 2x SODIMM slots with one occupied with a single 8GB DDR4 3200 module running at 2933 which at the least needs another module for dual channel mode and extra gaming breathing room. This really should be the first thing you do to lift your system performance. Companies selling gaming notebooks need to start offering them with 16GB as standard.256GB is about the baseline for storage for a gaming notebook as games are pretty massive these days. Luckily  the Nitro has a full 2.5  drive bay so you can either upgrade the primary storage or just install a nice  juicy 2.5  250GB to 4TB SSD in there and you will have plenty of room for extra games and storage.FINAL THOUGHTS:After using the Acer Nitro  I have to say I like it. While the smaller storage and single channel 8GB only memory may be an issue for some  the memory and storage deficiencies can be overcome by upgrading it to exactly what you need if the initial configuration does not fit the bill. I REALLY like the keyboard both for feel and backlight. The unit itself is very compact  well built and lightweight for what it provides. Cooling is excellent and the unit never thermal throttled while gaming or benchmarking which for a gaming laptop is the top criteria. With the Nvidia RTX 3050  I was able to play World of Warcraft at Ultra 10 max settings with Raytracing set to high (which is the max setting). While some may be wary of the 4 core / 8 thread 10th gen 10300h CPU  it was more than up to the task for gaming as the GPU was the bottleneck even at 1080p showing the gaming prowess of Intel s 10th gen CPUs.This would have been an easy 5 stars for me  but that display may be a deal breaker for a select few. I can deal with the poor response time as I am not a super fast twitch hardcore gamer and I had no problems gaming for hours  but the dismal color gamut and backlight bleed of what is known to be a poor gamers panel just drops it down a notch.Still  for the actual price of the unit (please don t give in to scalpers)  you are getting a lot of gaming power that even as is  will game right out of the box (Within 20 minutes I had WoW installed and was playing) and get the job done at a very economical price especially in these trying times.Considering the price  performance and build  it still nets a 5/5 I picked this up for lower end internet gaming  and am typing the review on it now. Performance is peppy  solid wifi  nice display and good quality components. On the pro side  I like the feel of the keyboard  and that the setup was pretty quick and painless - I was on line in an hour  so not bad at all. On the con side  this thing gets HOT on my lap while playing games  enough so that I got out a laptop cooling pad. It has the usual bloatware that you always get on these consumer grade machines  but it was surprisingly easy to get rid of. I suspect the image was several months old  since I had to go through a couple of cycles of Windows updates to get current  but all the drivers were up to date and I had no issues getting updates to apply. I charged it up before using it and got four hours on a charge  even with all the downloads and rebooting several times  and it charged up to full again in less than an hour while I was using it  so the battery is acceptable. Up to the usual Acer standards - it works  and it seems solid. The CPU isn t the best it could be for the money  the gpu is a 3050 which reviews are saying this mobile version is inferior to the old RX 580 from AMD  which means it s not very good at all and only has 4gb of vram  the amount of RAM and storage is also low. But they give you a 144htz screen. It does not make sense and for the money you could get better. If you want to game a 3060 should be the least you accept  since the 3050 is quite poor outside of old games or very low spec modern ones.It s rather overpriced to me and I m not impressed with the cost cutting they did. Acer has built a really nice entry-level gaming laptop here that s quite capable (scoring over 4900 points in Time Spy) and relatively nice looking - it has some gamer aesthetic touches like the red vents on the back and the red keyboard lighting but nothing too showy.The star of the show here is undoubtedly the graphics one-two punch of the Intel integrated graphics for long battery life when web browsing/consuming media/doing office work paired with the discrete nVidia GeForce RTX 3050 for gaming. Long battery here is relative  I could see it going for maybe 7-8 hours if you turn down the brightness just doing normal office work/web browsing on WiFi. Oddly  the keyboard backlight seems to take significant battery  so turn that off would help. The process is strong enough and balances well with the GPU  but a Core i5 4 core / 8 thread is mainstream here. Unlike most modern ultrabooks (which this is decidedly not at it s size)  this laptop has tons of upgrade potential with room to add a second PCIe NVMe drive and a 2.5  SATA SSD or HDD for more storage. It also has an open RAM slot - I would highly recommend adding a second 8GB stick to get to 16GB in dual channel which ups performance significantly  particularly on the integrated GPU or when multi-tasking. Accessing these slots is slightly challenging as the bottom of the laptop must be removed  which involves 10+ small screws and prying off the plastic. The port selection is good  with a collapsible ethernet port a nice addition to USB 3.0  HDMI and USB-C. The USB-C port sadly doesn t support power in  and so you must use the AC adapter which plugs into the back of the laptop in an odd move in recent times.Beyond the core of the CPU/GPU combo  the rest of the package shows the budget nature a bit more - the keyboard only offers red backlighting and is so-so - it s ok to type on but I dislike the design choice of chopping the shift button to give space to the arrow keys...though in gaming the arrow keys are more important. The laptop itself is mostly plastic  which is also ok as it s inoffensive  but not as premium as many other laptops today. The only real glaring bad here though is the screen. While it s big and fairly bright - and offers a strong 144hz refresh rate - the color reproduction is poor compared to other laptops I ve used recently and certainly vs desktop screens. Oranges tend to appear red and blues/greens dull - it s certainly workable  but may have you plugging in an external monitor when you can.Overall  if you don t need the color accuracy and don t mind the aesthetic touches  this is a good reasonably priced gaming laptop that can also do double duty as a work/productivity machine. You get a lot of power for the price - but get that second RAM stick  it s worth it! Not a heavy gamer  so I needed something that can play inde to AAA games just incase. I ve played stardew valley and subnautica with no issue on either. Was shipped to me in 4 days (overworld shipment)  the product is very good and has a very good value! Reci칠n sacada de la caja y no encendi칩 Me a encantado la laptop me a corrido todos los juegos que le e instalado sin problemas  y eso que solo tiene 8 gb de Ram For the price I think it s a solid deal honestly Added a second ram stick an a 1tb sad and it is solid great for a first time of player anyone has the laptop does not power on just push it firmly and u will have it working  u can change the charger it may help then ask for a refund. Got this laptop for gaming and it runs great! I love this laptop  it is able to play almost every modern game at fps over 40 and most stay above 60 if their settings are set for boosting fps. I like it :3so far... Very bad for gaming  the refresh rate is very good but overall this laptop is terrible couldn t even run gts 5 on low settings online 游녩游 Pretty good price for an amazing laptop estupenda computadora por el precio que tiene Para trabajar en familia No tiene mucha memoria So far no problems! I love it Me agrada This is the laptop to get if you want to game on a moderately sized portable laptop and don t mind opening up the laptop to upgrade it.The laptop has nice mid range specs for gaming overall: Full backlit keyboard with numpad  silky smooth 144hz matte screen  and an RTX 3050 Graphics GPU that will crank out those frames without excessive compromise to detail  and is even capable of light VR. The 8 thread Intel i5 10300H CPU uses older 14nm lithography than the current gen 10nm stuff so efficiency and heat will suffer slightly  but it is nevertheless perfectly adequate as most games are not CPU intensive anyway.For a $1000 laptop  the memory is equipped more like a web browsing thin-and-light laptop than the moderately-thick-and-moderately-portable gaming laptop it is. The 256gb SSD performs well for load times but will fill up rapidly if you aren t careful  considering some modern titles take up 100gb or more. 8GB RAM is adequate for many games  but has potential being a major bottleneck as the system itself consumes 3gb of your 8gb just idling.If you don t want to be limited to a small amount of browser tabs in your powerful gaming laptop  then you will need to upgrade the RAM. An additional 8GB 3200mhz PC4-25600 DDR4 SODIMM RAM will run you about $30-$50 at current prices. Thankfully  the laptop can be easily opened by opening up the bottom panel  with nothing more than a typical x shape Phillips screwdriver and a prying tool. There are no 랑arranty void stickers sealing the interior and you won t damage anything as long as you are gentle. There are 2 RAM slots  the 8gb of preinstalled RAM is thankfully a single stick that only takes one slot and I was able to insert and use a 3rd party ram stick of equal speed and capacity  no problem.As mentioned  256gb is a very limited amount of disk space that may not work for everyone  but you cannot simply slide in an extra SSD. There is space for a 2.5 slot but that slot is not equipped with a SATA connector  so if you want to upgrade the storage you will either have to rely on an external dongle (the USB 3 ports are capable of at least 1 GB/s speed)  or clone the system from the factory SSD onto a larger SSD. There also may or may not be a pin on the motherboard that you can buy a SATA connector for but I don t know enough about motherboards to say for sure.There is also no SD or micro SD card slot at all. I find it very interesting that Acer is omitting the SD card slot in multiple product lines ranging from small ultrabooks to their big 17 gaming laptop  to this laptop as well. Given the small disk space  an integrated card reader would have provided an easy way to upgrade storage.The coaxial barrel charge port is interesting: it is centered on the rear between the exhaust ports  rather than on the side. Power consumption when idling with the screen on is about 35W. Power consumption in a stress test pushing cpu  gpu and screen brightness to the max with no peripherals connected is measured at 154W. When stress tested in this state  displayed GPU temperature hovers at 62C in a well ventilated 76F environment.The exhaust shoots out the back and to the side as well  so if you use this sitting next to someone you may annoy your neighbor with hot laptop exhaust.+ This does include a battery management option to limit to 80%  and I recommend you turn this on as keeping the battery charged at 100% is bad for longevity. The option can be accessed in the ㄹcer care center in the 띾heckup section.+ 57.48 watt hours is the size of the relatively small battery pack. The battery does not contain any special technology to supply 150W of power  it is only capable of 60W output so when unplugged you get an hour of use with significantly reduced performance. Interestingly Acer uses the same battery pack for the larger and more powerful 17 3050Ti model of the Nitro 5  so if you intend on gaming on battery power  there isn t much benefit to getting the 17 model in terms of performance since the RTX 3050 GPU itself is able to gobble more than 60W (the TGP power use can be as high as 80W) and the battery will be the main bottleneck anyway.+ The laptop is able to supply at least 15W to at least 1 USB port. Nothing too fancy but a decent amount of power for more hungry usb peripherals.+ By default the backlight turns off after 30 seconds but this behavior can be disabled in Acer Nitro. Red is a good eye friendly color for keyboard backlights  providing illumination without distraction+I did achieve 950mbps on wired gigabit internet- The laptop has a type C port but does not charge itself by type C at all  the main purpose of the type C port is for information transfer. Usually laptops with C ports allow charging from type c which is cool because type C charging is much more convenient than AC charging  plus there is the potential of using a power bank. The (much more expensive) Dell XPS17 charges by type C from its 130W charger  yet this Nitro 5 with similar power consumption refuses to draw any power from the wall type C charger at all. To be clear  laptops don t need the charger to supply the full power  if the external power is weak then they will simply enter a deficit and slowly drain down the battery.- Volume and brightness buttons are in a weird place: fn+arrow keys rather than on the function key row.+Silky smooth 144hz screen for competitive gaming and other high framerate content. You get a normal amount of bezels and no touchscreen which is fine by me. 1080p is plenty for enjoying gaming and movies  a bit low for productivity. The matte screen isn t too bright but does a good job making the screen usable in bright light  the difference between max brightness and minimum brightness is around 3Watts of power. It s a cliche  but you get what you pay for.This gaming laptop is about the bottom of the barrel in terms of laptop gaming systems. The RAM  storage  CPU and GPU are about as low as you d want to go for modern gaming titles  especially with a 144Hz display. Here are my overall thoughts:BUILD:-The entire body is made of plastic. I have another gaming laptop that was priced similarly and has a metal case. The body of this laptop feels pretty cheap  so take good care of it.RAM/STORAGE:-8GB of RAM for 2021 gaming makes little sense. I understand this is a budget laptop  but an extra 8GB of RAM is so cheap (~$40)  it makes no sense not to include it. An upgrade after purchase to 16GB is highly recommended. Yes  you can play most titles at 8GB  but you will lose a few frames and you cannot multitask or  alt-tab  while playing as you will run out of RAM. The speed (2933Mhz) is adequate  though 3200 would have been nice. I also measured the read speed of this laptop s SSD at around 1800Mbps  which tells me it s not the highest quality (TLC Gen3x4) NVMe drive. I have had other NVMe SSDs read at around 3400Mbps.CPU/GPU-The CPU is good. Even though it s only a 10th Gen i5 (Quad core)  Intel chips do very well with gaming and it boosts up to around 4.5GHz  so it s quite snappy while playing games or doing anything really. The GPU is pretty pathetic  however  The RTX 3050 is the least competent of all the RTX GPUs. While it sounds nice having a 3000 series ray-tracing card  the fact is  this is even slower than a 2060  and it only has 4GB of VRAM. That might be a deal-breaker for most  and I can understand why. Some of the games I installed -- such as Watch Dogs: Legion -- refuse to go over 40 frames consistently because of this inadequacy.COOLING:-This is where the laptop excels  for me anyway. During gaming -- while on battery or AC power -- the laptop was able to keep the CPU and the case fairly cool (relatively speaking) most of the time. Sure  there will be CPU spikes in the 90s (Celsius)  most of the time  but that s normal for laptops (especially gaming laptops)  and this stays in the 70s or 80s most of the time to prevent thermal throttling. The case of the laptop also stays cooler than some other  albeit more powerful  gaming laptops I ve used. This could be due to the fact that it s made of plastic rather than metal.EXPANDABILITY:-Good. The laptop comes with an extra NVMe slot  a spot for a 2.5  SSD or hard drive and an extra RAM slot. Upgrading the laptop just requires removing some screws (around 10 or so) and prying the back of the case off.Overall  this is not a bad laptop overall. However  as a gaming laptop it is lacking -- and doesn t make a lot of sense. My main issue is that it is built with some of the most low-end CPU and GPU yet it has a 144Hz display. Unless you are playing eSports exclusively  it s doubtful you ll ever get much more than 50 or 60 frames out of the games at medium to high settings. Sure  you can probably turn the settings down to their lowest levels in most games and get higher frames  but is it worth it just for the higher refresh ratee? That s up to you  which leads me to my final point: If you don t care about high-quality textures  ambient occlusion and anti-aliasing features  this laptop is great for you. You can turn down in-game settings and enjoy the higher refresh rate. However  if -- like me -- you enjoy high-quality textures and shadows (and even some ray tracing)  you might want to plop down an extra Benjamin for the next step up. My wife and I like to do some casual gaming now and then  and the most intensive games that we ve played in the past year are Divinity Original Sin 2  7 Days to Die  and L4D2. We general don t need the fastest computers to get decent framerates at 1080p.The 2021 Nitro 5 is a decent upgrade for an aging Predator Helios 300 (i7-7700HQ  1060 6GB) that we ve been using. It scored a 4824 in 3DMark TimeSpy  which is a pretty significant improvement over the ~3900 achieved by the older Helios 300. After upgrading the Nitro 5 to 16GB (2 x 8GB)  the score went up to 4932. You can see the two screen grabs attached to my review.The two Acer laptops actually use the same rated 180W 19.5V power supply  but the newer one that came with the Nitro 5 is considerably more compact. The power connectors are the same too  and I ve been able to use the two power supplies interchangeably with both laptops.The Nitro 5 comes with a single 8GB stick of Hynix DDR4 3200 RAM  and CPU-Z reports that it is single rank. You also get a Western Digital SN530 256GB SSD that provides very nice performance for an OEM drive. From what I could gather  the SN530 might be the OEM equivalent of the popular SN550 (not 100% sure).Despite being an entry level laptop  Acer provides some really nice upgrade options. There are two RAM slots  one already taken up with the 8GB of Hynix. The system has TWO PCI-E slots (one taken up by the SN530) and a 2.5  drive tray. The cable and screws for a 2.5  drive are included in separate plastic bags. I opted to install a spare NVME SSD into the the second PCI-E slot.The build quality feels pretty good for a plastic gaming laptop  and it s significantly lighter than our Helios 300 (2017) and Omen 15 (2018). Removing the bottom panel to access the RAM and HDD slots is easy enough; you have to remove a number of screws  and then you can pry the panel away without even using a spudger tool.The keyboard feels fine to me  but I ve never had strong opinions about keyboards. The touchpad is surprisingly good for a Windows touchpad; it might be the best one I ve used on a Windows laptop so far  but that s also not saying much. It s still not quite as good as the Mac touchpad  but it s getting closer.The screen is fairly impressive as well  supporting 1080p at 144hz. This is my first experience with a G-Sync monitor  and it s pretty amazing. Everything in Windows looks very smooth and it s hard to go back after gaming with a high refresh rate. My only minor complaint is that the image looks slightly washed out at full brightness  but this is pretty easily fixed by turning down the game brightness a bit.Supposedly  there s a recent or upcoming Acer firmware that increases the TGP of the GPU from 70W to 75W  but I couldn t find any specific versions or release dates regarding this as of July 2021. My laptop came with firmware v2.03  which is currently the latest version.Overall  this laptop is pretty good value for casual gamers who want something portable. The 70W/75W RTX 3050 isn t going to amaze anyone  but it s pretty good for 1080p gaming. Coupled with the i5-10300H CPU  this entry-level laptop offers solid improvements over our mid-range Helios 300 from 2017. Do not buy. There isn t enough memory to even download games on this laptop. 2 if your lucky. Good laptop for playing games at medium settings at a steady 60fps on certain games. 8gb of ram is not enough though. recommend upgrading to 16gb of ram if you plan on playing games. Otherwise no issues when using it for the first time and runs great! Bought this as a Christmas gift for my oldest son for gaming  it works great and he is having a blast plating all his favorite games I normally don t write reviews but I was so impressed I had to. First of all  came 3 days sooner than predicted which is a win of itself. The packaging was pretty well protected and came with a nice little lanyard. The display is sharp and the speed is fast. It didn t break the bank overall a great laptop I loved this laptop. High speed with graphics memory but hard disk capacity is not enough for me DoA ! 1 Star for now . Purchased as a Christmas gift for my child and when she opened it and we got it plugged in . It will not power on or charge . It shows no indication of charging (the light is on not when plugged in. Tried troubleshooting but none of the suggested methods I found work . I Would not recommend this product The computer came dead and unable to charge. A complete disappointment. And Amazon did NOT refund the purchase for days after I sent it back. I highly discourage a big item purchase through Amazon. This is great for light gaming but don t expect high fps. I saw someone complaining about it not having enough storage. This laptop comes with a extra m.2 slot and a 2.5  SSD slot. It s easy to upgrade storage and ram It s a really good laptop. It can run so many games! I play Valorant  Minecraft  OW and more and I haven t came across any issues while gaming. I also use it for school when I m not playing anything. I suggest having it plugged in while using it/playing  other than that  everything is gooood  I m really happy with it! :D +Fast work  bright display - 8GB ram is low for some programming Update: It s fine  you need to push in the charger really hard For the price you can t go wrong. Acer hasn t treated me wrong yet. 100% would recommend. It runs pretty good Broken right out of the box. Did not charge and did not turn on. Llego con la pantalla da침ada gran producto con el detalle del teclado en ingles Thing was broken  doesn t turn on at all give me my money back La mejor calidad precio Best budget gaming laptop for getting started. 144Hz refresh rate gives smooth scrolling and gaming Got ir under $800 and its a very good laptop. Playing games like witcher 3 flawlessly. The cooling is nice in this laptop  and mi cpu doesn t get pass 55춿 in cold rooms while playing witcher which is the game im currently playing. The computer wouldn t charge straight out of the box. I plugged it into every available outlet  all of which work. I made sure every connection point was snug  and that the charger was fully into the laptop  and still no charge. quiero agradecerte hoy recibimos nuestra nueva laptor ...super r치pido y muy oportuna ...todo venia muy bien empacado y el producto en optimas condiciones ....que gusto hacer negocios con alguien tan serio y cumplido mil gracias Frames will be locked at 60 automatically  you have to change the settings yourself. The laptop can barely run a small game without issues  I m kind of disappointed. I use this 랂aming laptop for everything besides gaming now. Could not tell you anything about it because It was damaged I received the laptop and couldn t figure out why it wasn t charging. Read a lot of reviews to see what the problem was and after 20 minutes I just pushed the charger into port harder until it clicked a second time. La pantalla no es tan buena porque cuando juegas se ve como una clase de l칤nea rara pero corre muy bien los Juegos solo necesita que le metas m치s ram y listo Good but the charger didn t fit. Luckily my son had one that fir Gpu only limited to 30W on battery  meaning mist be pluged in using dgpuAlso you cannot undervolt the cpu  it throttles beyond 75CThis suits a perfect gaming stationary pc for TV setup Product upon arrival would not turn on  or take a charge. The media could not be loaded. \\xa0Es una muy buena laptop  f치cil de upgradear  una pantalla que si da los 144 Hz  un procesador muy decente y la tarjeta gr치fica tiene lo suyo  a pesar de ser de 4 GB  corre el CoD Warzone a 80 fps con todo altoA칰n me falta probarlo con m치s juegos  pero Minecraft  Left 4 Dead  rocket league  da todo a m치s de 100 fps establesSolamente es recomendable invertir en m치s memoria (Tiene slot para una SSD y un HDD) y otra memoria ram (m치ximo 32 GB en ambos slots)Si vas iniciando  es una muy buena opci칩n  no es pesada  es bonita y solamente le echar칤a en falta la entrada para micr칩fono  de ah칤 en fuera todo bien La verdad me gust칩 bastante considerando el precio al que la compr칠  la consegu칤 en 16 mil pesos y es imposible conseguir una laptop con las mismas caracter칤sticas a ese precio en M칠xico  10/10 Excelente equipo para jugar o trabajo diario.

I m just so bummed I got this for Christmas and my heart lit up with joy only to just crumple up when the computer doesn t even work. Don t buy this  save yourself from the misery on Christmas morning. This was great  untill the keyboard died about a week after warranty expired. Tech support quoted almost $400 to fix...It was awesome  until it stopped working. I was hoping to use this for at least 3 years before getting a new one. I ve had this laptop for almost two years and the main problem I have with it. Is it over heating and it doesnt stay charged long. Worst computer the hinges broke in 1 year did not last would not buy The media could not be loaded. \\xa0Really good laptop but the Esc button gets stuck and is annoying I will like to fix it but is a really powerful laptop for entry-level gaming - I thought it was dead on arrival  but you have to really pay attention to how you plug it the port in the back. There is an extra pin that clicks when you push a little harder. I learned this after a mild panic attack and much research.As a single mom I bought this laptop on Black Friday. With working in retail I didn t have a chance to open it and charge it/load it with all the cool things from Steam before Christmas Eve when I was about to wrap it - saying I had to work but secretly went to a friends house to wrap gifts. When plugging it in  the charge light didn t light up. I must have unplugged/tested the outlets a million times  crying because all my son wanted for christmas was a gaming laptop.After some googling I found a forum talking about this. Glad I did. I ll update and see how it actually performs once my son starts gaming on it.What a heart attack for no reason. It should really specify this  because when you just plug it in there is a click before you have to push harder  for another click to charge. Muy buena laptop  para jugar est치 incre칤ble  quiz치 no tiene tanta memoria pero se puede expandir. Lo 칰nico  malo  fue que me tardo 1mes en llegar  parec칤a de Ali expr칠ss Haha  15 d칤as en confirmar y 15 en llegar a칰n habiendo pagado priority.La seguir칠 usando y m치s adelante ver칠 si actualizo mi comentario. De verdad que esta computadora me ha soprendido  anteriormente tenia una laptop Thunderobot con una RTX 3060 comprada en Ali la cual la vendi por que alguien me la quiso comprar y entonces al andar buscando otra laptop me tope con esta la cual la recomendaban en una pagina de expertos en gaming  el dia que la compra estaba en 19 999   dije bueno ok   12 mil menos que la computadora anterior   voy a darme la oportunidad de comprarla al cabo que Amazon acepta devoluciones  total que me llego en 9 dias  inmediatamente la destape ya que averigue que no pierdes la garantia al hacer lo  le aumente la memoria RAM para que dar en 16GB  le coloque un NVMe Samsung 970 evo plus de 1TB  y un disco mecanico 2.5 Sata de 1 Tb  ya con todo listo y funcionando   instale sniper elite 4  dead stranding  control  wolfenstein young blood  microsofot flight simulator 2021 Forza Horizon 4  Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts  Halo Master Chief  A Plague Tale Innocence  Ori and the Will of the Wisps Doom Eternal NBA 2K Play Grounds entre otros   de todos estos juegos el unico que me dio Lag fue el forza Horizon 4  pero todos los demas los he jugado sin problema alguno  sinceramente recomiendo esta computadora  si quieres mayor potencia  te aconsejo que te armes una de escritorio con una rtx 3070 como minimo  porque entre esta laptop y una rtx 3060 no vi mucha diferencia en los juegos. lo unico malo que el precio se ha elevado bastante  al momento que estoy escribiendo esta rese침a ya va en 27 y fraccion  ojala la vuelvan a bajar o la puedan encontrar en otra en mejor precio. I have read the bad reviews and decided to go ahead and yes indeed  it  does not start  at all. Actually  u just need to press the adaptor hard enough to hear a click. Once done  u can run it on battery or charger. It will not turn on probably to save the battery life while on storage.Shipping is amazing and very light  bright and powerful! Loving it but keeping my fingers crossed.'"

       "'This is a great entry gaming laptop for my 12 year old who will be 13 next month The colors and graphics are great  he loves the lighted keyboard  and this definitely has a bit of weight which contributes to the sturdiness I also like that it s also just a great laptop as well We were able to upgrade for Windows 11 for free At home  he now uses this computer vs the school assigned Chrome  for his Zoom math tutoring sessions the camera and microphone is decent we still use a separate microphone  and to also complete his homework on Google classroomOther features I also like the number of inputs which has more than my Lenovo X1 Carbon ThinkPad  and the ability to wirelessly connect the laptop to your tv as a second extended screen is pretty coolOverall this was a present for his good grades  and it also works great for homework assignments and video conferencing as added bonuses I m definitely loving this laptopI have a gaming rig with a Ryzen 5 3rd gen and XFX main card  and this laptop holds up with all the AAA titles I play on my big rig  BUT I can take it anywhereThe only reason this gets a 4 star is because it clearly states that there are supposed to be 2 stick PCIE SSD slots with a 25  HDD port to upgrade storageWhen I popped this bugger open to add storage and RAM  low and behold I find it has only 1 stick SSD slots and a 25 Luckily I bought a 25  SSD instead of a stick PCIE since this thing clearly has a spot on the MB to have that extra PCIE slot but there is nothing there So basically I get 1 PCIE and 1 25  HDD port instead of 2Super disappointed  considering there is even a Nitro 5 sticker that says  Available slots 2 SSD  1 HDD Unfortunately not true at all Unfortunately  the unit won t power on I can t tell if it s the laptop itself or if it s a bad power supplyUpdate user error I wasn t plugging in the power cord all the way as seen in the picture I got this because Acer told me this was compatible with Oculus 2 When I received it  it was not compatible When I contacted Acer support Support told me I needed to purchase a model with 32MB memory Sales tells you one thing  support tells you another I got the better model at 1400 That one did not work either I am a 66yr old man with RedGreen colour blindness The keyboard was so hard to read even on full brightness that I sent it back on that alone If you are a young dude or someone with good eyesight it won t be a problem to you I also learned that some Nitro s have a menu where you can change the keyboard colour  not my one I learnt  Turn the lights off and see what colour the keys are  if White you have RGB if Red  they stay Red Goodness I ordered one of these laptops  only to have it arrive and find it has a defective charging port I noticed it  and a representative at Best Buy confirmed  there was a bent prong in the port I talked to an Amazon rep  and they sent me a replacement Having gotten now a 2nd laptop with the same defect  I can confidently say to STAY AWAY from this I was really looking forward to using this laptop  and even used my free trial of Amazon prime I d been saving so I could get it over my vacation from work Having gotten two defective laptops just killed that for me Just to cut to it  this specific model of the Nitro 5 is incredibly a solid allaround from the lots of room to expand storageRAM  great keyboard  good cooling  etc The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPSThe negatives for me come in twofold the display and battery life1 The display being 144hz and IPS is great and all  but the actual quality of it is below mediocre While backlight bleed is expected for an IPS panel  it s weirdly uneven and discolored Also  I m not sure if it s a defect with my specific device  but the display can t produce the color red accurately it s more orangish and overall things look a bit flat and there s no way to actually fix it besides finding your own ICC file And even then you might as well use an external monitor2 The battery life is terrible Even on powersaving mode the laptop barely lasts 5 hours  and that s just doing basic internet browsing I m honestly considering not being bothered with it and just removing the battery entirely I had this laptop about 3 months now and everything still seems to be doing pretty good the temp never went over 200 degrees F but I do have it on a cooling pad  and I turn the internal cooling fans on the highest settings with the nitro sense when i play something somewhat intensive and I don t play many intensive games the I5 core will most likely have a rough time playing the latest games but it will run something like escape from tarkov like butter at 75 to over 100 fps in ultrasettings you might want to get another 8gig stick of ram to pop in and upgrade the ssd storage but over all I m very satisfied for what this computer is and can do it is my very first gaming laptop and I feel it somewhat replaced my xbox for someone who s never had a dedicated laptop for gaming or a computer at all  I feel this is one of the best first steps into pc gaming For a budget gaming laptop  this Acer Nitro 5 has good enough specs  the Core i5 and the RTX 3050 are sufficient The problem and it s a big one  is the display The image on this laptop is AWFUL No matter how much I tried to calibrate the colors  it looks bad The colors are washed and the screen is dim whether it s game or a movie this screen won t do it justice Too bad because I like many other aspects of this laptop like the relatively long battery life and the redcolored keyboard I find myself playing more on my 2 years old Legion 5 which looks way better than this newer Acer Nitro 5 Even for under 1000  you can get something better So i got this and I don t really mess with these things but what pisses me off is haven t to fix every little thing This laptop well really good for like a week or two until i noticed stupid frame drops  fortnite literately being unplayable and all I then found the darn reason  I used Intel Xtu and saw the problem  overheating every darn time I have a coolpad for this and my room is literally cold not blazin hot but yeah the cpu will hit 90 degrees The gpu temps are always fine but the cpu sucks so hard so no wonder fortnite is unplayable I found a couple options on reddit  they were to fix it myself by buying thermal paste  send it to acer to add shitty thermal paste so i can have this problem in a couple weeks again  or return and refund Thing is  i got this well priced and the 3050 does what i need it for I kid you not i play almost every game nearly max with optimizations done at that 144 fps and i have used programs to see my avg so yeah Forza horizon 5 is the only thing I can t run at those frames cause the gpu has too few ram or whatever it uses  it s only 4gb And yeah i did buy additional 8gb ram and 1tb ssdSo yeah  the games run well overwatch  apex  definitely not fortnite  rainbow 6 But it has heating issues  I m personally going to exchange this and see if amazon does my a biggie by sending a unit before i send this one in cause i need a laptop  i know they did me this one time with another big purchase so shoutout to themEdit forgot to include that yes even with max fans the cpu thermal throttles I know how to use nitrosence The media could not be loaded \\xa0It s a great laptop  able to upgrade as you please and has a backlit keyboard no it does not change color The keyboard isn t loud and feels comfortable to type on I love how the charging port is behind the laptop instead of on the side as it would get in the way I m glad I chose this laptop as my first I recommend buying this if you enjoy playing games as much as I do After paying a chunk of money for this laptop  you ld think that it would be well protected for shipping with something more than one sheet of paper Look at the size of that shipping box Sure hope it works Got this machine for my kids for general use and gaming There were a few negative Amazon reviews which I wanted to add some perspective to  in case it helps someone1 The packaging was excellent for the laptop itself In its original ACER box  it has 15  2 inches of high density foam protecting the laptop Honestly  I think the laptop could be shipped in this packaging alone and be fine I did get 2 laptops and both were boxed together both acer boxes were shipped in a larger box While they were not packed tightly  they arrived undamaged no box chafing  dents  or slashes2 The male end of the power supply which plugs into the back of the laptop must be firmly pressed until it clicks There is a detent which I had missed initially  until I pressed harder You know its fully seated when it clicks  but also when the blue charge light goes on Without having the power supply fully seated  you will not be able to power on the device I could imagine someone receiving the laptop and thinking it was DOA because they did not fully seat the connectorI ve had a total of 6 ACER laptops in my household all have been hassle free machines We ll see how durable they are  but based on my first impression of prior history with this brand  I would buy this product again I received this laptop and pulled it right out the box only to learn that it does not work The repair for the laptop has been an absolute nightmare I was responsible for packaging this laptop up to send in for repair and finding a local fedex to ship it out of which was also a horrible experience According to the company  my repair is complete and now lies in the hands of fedex I wish I could get rid of this headache by simply returning the product back to Amazon but I don t even have the product to send back Worse decision ever was purchasing this laptop Be careful I bought the Acer Nitro 5 with the i5 10300H CPU and the RTX 3050 I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgradesProsThe visual fidelity is outstanding Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing Forza Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settingsThe Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard Much better usage than on a PCIt is very lightweight and portableScreen has soft colors but is very crispBoot times are very fastConsThe battery life is atrocious but who isn t gaming without plugging in first Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hoursThe laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphonesThe layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you ll want to disable it and use a mouseOverall  this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer The budgeting option to spend 168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me If you are going to buy a laptop for any reason  might as well get a gaming one like this This is my first laptop after a decade and I am very happy to purchase this one So many good words about Nitro 5s  even this one is not one of the better ones  I added another 8Gb ram and 2 TB 25 SSD to make it bit more usable Not that anything wrong with 8Gb ram and 256Gb SSD but 8Gb rams are not that expensive at all these days I had 2TB SSD from my big computer  just switched it over Talking about upgrading the laptop  it s so easy Comes with everything you need to add another 25 SSD YouTube videos helped me out though  made my job a lot easier This computer does play FPS games  and plays them very smooth The fans start running though  and you might think it s overheating  that s not the case  it s normal They don t go full speed I also play mobile games and stream through laptop no heating no fan issues at all it s like so smooth and easy for the machine For this price  I highly recommend it  if you are in a tight budged like I am One more thing for this laptop  I am going to travel Europe next year  and it won t be problem bringing it with me  since it is travel friendly  Ever since my son got this for his birthday  he has yet to emerge from his room I walked into his room the other day  not knowing he was there  opened the shades and got hissed at by what I can only assume was my son I did not recognize him through all the soda cans and candy wrappersThis laptop has changed his gaming experience No lag  great graphics and lightweight I asked my son if he liked it  and I can only assume he said yes  as he just got a sly grin and continued to slaughter the aliens with his eyes wide open Got this laptop as a gift and its perfect for any gamer I am not a big gamer but the display when playing League of Legends is amazing To experience the full capability of the laptop  its best to use when plugged in to the power A full battery gives about 4 hours if its used for minimal tasks Overall  its a great gaming laptop  graphics are awesome  I like the keyboard travel It actually light as compared to other laptops Would definitely recommend I order laptop from my daughters account  after plugin no lights no charging  I run small computer repair business  I know little bit about computers  I used my testing power supply and other option to reset machine from keyboard but nothing works  no replacement options from Amazon other than return so I did return  I am not able to reorder the product due to 01 per customerBeside my disliking to Acer products due to poor tech support  I want to give it a try therefore I orderd another machine from my personal account and I was in disbelief that 2nd laptop also not working no lights no charging  this time I called Acer support line  they try to help me out with tips which I already tried  2nd machine going back and I will save my money for better laptop Model Acer Nitro 5 AN5155553E5 Upgrade  Linux infoMy first order of this came DOA It happens sometimes The replacement came quickly this has 2x M2 NVME slots I added a Samsung 980 1TB no need to buy an extra screw I also added another 8GB ram Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 2666 MHz CL19 Laptop Memory By adding things myself it made it cheaper than buying a more expensive unit Yes it is only an I5 but I do not need a lot I does exactly what I need and well Battery life is about 2 or 3 hours depending on what youre doing I always expect horrible battery life so Im not shocked the keys feel nice red backlit only Meh but the intensity can be decreased or increased via the keys in Linux  WindowsLINUX  load Windows into safe mode  go into bios  ctrl  S will show the add the option to allow you to change the mode to AHCI reboot to windows and take it back out of safe mode Install linux as normal For this unit I install ElementaryOS with zero issues and left windows on the factory NVME Everything works as expected including the microphone and camera I would recommend a mouse  mousepad but thats your call If you are nervous about installing linux or it is your first time  remove the 256GB nvme  install linux on the added drive  replace 256GB  update grub  sudo updategrub Hope this helps someone out there I know the open source community and Linux always look for someone who has run gauntlet to see how it works My husband is still fighting an HP Omen because Intel and their Microphone  Got one brand new and it didn t even charge or turn on A very expensive paper weight The case is great  super slim and modern The keyboard is only red  no customization Keep having an issue with the audio driver Will randomly stop all audio output and will tell me no audio device installed Good for games like minecraft and roblox  but seemed to get choppy with Stormworks Tiene un rendimiento excelente para su precio Refrigera muy bien lo cual es estupendo ya que vivo en un 치rea calurosa  los videojuegos corren perfectos a m치s de 170fps con m치xima calidad y eso que a칰n no le hago overclock al chip de video ni al procesador Lo 칰nico que no me gust칩 es que la bios viene muy  muy restringida The nitro 5  ANY MODEL is supposed to have one free year of acer 247 technical support It did not come with it Awesome laptop with an awesome price I could not give any higher praise And it is easily upgradeable The RAM can be upgraded  and I bought the Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200MHz CL22 here on Amazon Easily installed to give the laptop a total of 16GB but you can upgrade it even higher Next upgrade will be a 1TB SSD  because the only part that would take away from this amazing laptop is the low amount of storage but their are options to increase that as well I only got the 256GB SSDThanks for reading My son got this laptop for Christmas and he loves it Great beginner gaming laptop It was super easy to setup Literally set everything up in less than 30 minutes Worth every penny so fart Great laptop  fast too Destiny 2 originally played at 80fps when I updated the drivers for gaming it dropped to 30fps why The power supply has to be plugged in VERY firmly to the back of the laptop It didn t look like it could go farther in  and the laptop wasn t charging I pressed again really firmly and heard a click  then it finally started to charge Does not turn on Never had an issue like this with a brand new computer Returning today Took and it out of the box and it was doa So sent it back Donot waste your money It arrived dead and would not turn on I bought it for my son s birthday Not only it arroved broken but also was late on delivery Please send a new power adaptor  the three circles will NOT fit need a new one ASAP I am not at all disappointed with this laptop Screen is beautiful It is super fast It does need an upgrade in memory8GB for 40 and HDD1TB for 80  but it appears to be pretty easy to access and upgrade They even give you the cable for the HDD upgrade Will be testing out a few games  in the next couple days Did not purchase for high end gaming  so I think I will be pleased  based on how quickly this thing moves for everyday activities I ordered this gaming laptop so that my son 9 and I could play online games together This was a Christmas gift It DOES NOT WORK It will not turn on  charged or uncharged  while plugged into any of three different outlets  all of which work for other devices Basically  I was sent a 1000 nonfunctional device This is unacceptable at best and my son is DEVASTATED I cannot begin to express how upset I am with this Bought this for my wife to do audio video processing and some light gaming I upgraded it out of the box to 16gb of ram and added a 1tb nvme m2 drive It works perfect and can handle any video editing and even very modern game titles with ease With right at 1000 invested it was a good deal I just opened the box and wanted to set it up but guess what Doesn t turn on  doesn t charge  doesn t do anything I tried numerous outlets thinking that was the problem but nope Just a very expensive brick Terrible quality control My first ACER lasted a little over a year before it died I saved up and purchased this ACER and it is pretty much DOA The manufacturer wanted me to ship for up to 10 business days Don t have time for that so returned through Amazon Done with this brand It doesn t turn on at all LED indicators not lighting up even when plugged in Already called tech support Didn t help at all  decided to just return it I saved up for this laptop for a long time  and I received it broken  it will not charge no matter what I try I ve read other comments like this and I m extremely disappointed in the similar reviews I ve returned it and I m waiting for a refund This straight up didn t turn on Pissed off Basically Spent 800 on a piece of metal and plastic Does not power on No charging indicator light Does not charge Doesn t power on while plugged in Arrived DOA Refunding I purchased this as a Christmas gift but it would not turn on  even after attempting to charge overnight I was sent a replacement  which would arrive after Christmas I was extremely disappointed to say the least Luckily  the replacement works I got sent not one  but TWO laptops back to back that did not work Save yourself the trouble  buy elsewhere Horrible product You must firmly press the adapter to the back It looks like it s plugged in but it probably isn t Keep pushing against the back of the laptop until you feel a click Failure to do so will result in the laptop not powering on Great portable pc  battery doesn t really last but it s basically a gaming pc whenever it s plugged in and running the rtx I can run destiny 2  apex  csgo  split gate  etc with very little lag My only other complaint besides the battery is the storage space on it  if your getting this laptop I d recommend investing in a couple terabytes of external space  and a mouse cause the pad on the laptop is kind of in an awkward spot if your trying too use wasd controls but all that aside  it s a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice budget gaming laptop游뱇 Got this as a christmas gift for my kid and its a good thing I checked it first I plug it in and notice the charging light doesn t activate I try to power it up and it wont turn on Hoping this gets resolved soon but even if I get a replacement it wont get here in time for the holiday This review is going to be a 1 star pending a working replacement being sent Works for gaming CSGO  LOL  etc CPU is meh  hits 100 often Really good laptop for the price Runs games at ultra graphics like a gem The only reason I give it four stars is because they sent me a broken charger and I had to buy a new one But they did refund me for the charger at least Also the battery does die pretty quickly Other than that it s a great purchase I purchased this as a gift for my nephew and we did not open it until Christmas The screen ended up being cracked and there customer care was well below satisfactory They would not even work with me on an exchange or refund of any kind even after I sent pictures I now have a 900 dollar laptop that does not work and a child without his Christmas present Would never purchase from this company again I recommend you Work on your customer satisfaction and service I purchased the i510300HRTX3050 version of this laptopI was looking for a laptop with specific specs for under 1 000 and this checked all the boxesI wanted a 15inch laptop with an amazing looking screen with and IPS panel running at 144Hz and a decent GPU that could utilize itI ended up getting this laptop and adding a 500GB SSD additional storage and 8gb of Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz to bump this up to 16GB total This ended up making the laptop much cheaper then buying one with that much ram and size of SSD in it on its ownThe way the heat is distributed on this laptop near the back by the screen keeps my wrists from burning up like I have had with prior laptopsThis thing has been able to run every game I play with at least 60fps on ultra settingsNew world ultra settings  around 6080fpsFF14 ultra settings  around 100 fps tbd the areaCall of duty medium settings  around 120 did this on purpose to take advantage of the higher refresh rateSmite Ultra settings  80 fpsThis laptop is hands down the best bang for your buck If you are really looking for a higher end laptop then your going to be spending between the 15002000 mark If you are trying to keep it under 1000 this was the best performance I was able to find for the price I m in love with this laptop I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it  i ll say it This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY It doesn t miss a single beat Loads in less than 30 seconds  and that s only with 8 gb of RAM The screen quality is so nice too  it looks like it has an overlay almost It starts up quickly  loads web pages super fast I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even I don t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops  but if you re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics  you will be BLOWN AWAY The laptop is super light and thin The keyboard has a nice feel to it  i like the back light but i wish you could change the color I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet  and it doesn t heat up that much at all It does slow down a little without being hooked up  but i don t plan on using it portably so I can t speak to that This was worth every penny  and I m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price I don t see how it gets any better than this for little ol  me The unit arrived dead Plugged in the AC adapter firmly  checked cords  we had a second AC adapter of the same specs Power lights never lit up and the unit would not turn onI ordered a second one It just arrived and it game dead I have to send this one back now too Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in Looks like a nice expensive paperweight The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptopDecided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra 100 after the price went up Customer service was not accommodating in the least The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again que bruto pongale 0 recibi la laptop hace un par de dias y me asuste mucho  porque no encendia  ni cargaba ni encendia ninguna luz la deje toda la noche conectada pensando que podia haber venido descargada de bateria  pero nada al dia siguiente ya estaba a punto de contactar a soporte para enviarla a garantia  y me puse a leer el manual cuya instruccion decia  al conectar el cargador asegurese de empujarlo hasta escuchar un clickahi estaba el fallo despues de conectarlo correctamente  encendio de una y hasta ahora vade maravillas I anticipate your questions  was the AC adapter plugged in correctly  was the outlet working I checked both several times  all fine  just no response from the battery charge light  no lights whatsoever  no charge  no startThis is directly after unboxing  btw  so it was incredibly disappointing to be shipped a 750 dollar paperweight I am in the process of getting my refund  and will never purchase an ACER again Good laptop  this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it s 2933 and you should be okay I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance  2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit For games like WoW open world 89144 fps out questing PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with mediumhigh settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit But is great at 1080p seeing it s a smaller screen resolution  1080p looks amazing color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does Honestly I think it s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 25 sata drive slot as well I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4 I can t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700 range that only runs on integrated graphics it s just not worth the money Like a moth to a flame I was mesmerized by the value and great review ratings and I ignored the fact that there are at least SIX REVIEWS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS saying their machine like mine wouldn t even turn on Most stores would recognize this as a problem but Amazon shamefully just keeps selling this junk This was in my house 3 hours before I got my money back along with arrangements for them to pick up the craptop at my door to return it I will find another non Acer laptop  and I will buy it from somewhere other than Amazon There has to be a price to pay for knowingly selling defective productsEDIT Just want to address the 랓ou have to press the charger plug in extra hard comments from other reviews Imagine you buy a brand new car and the dealer tells you that you need to use extra force when you close your door otherwise it will stay open and the car won t run Are you going to be ok with that Not me And even if that s the issue  why didn t support know it when I talked to them Also why is the battery at zero  therefore requiring the charger to power up My replacement MSI worked perfectly right out of the box I love this laptop  I push my laptop pretty hard  I use Blender  Daz3d and a few other software s for 3d modeling and rendering this laptop can handle it pretty well with blender cycles I could do optiX gpu rendering in Daz Studio I was able to get a decent render using Nivdia iray with pretty good real time feed back for games I was able to play Planetside 2 at a pretty good resolution at a good frame rate probably not like 120 fps on ulta high but it didnt dip below 30 with two m2 drives on the bottom and a full ssd slot as well cable is included so if you buy second hand watch out I was able to get good storage ram is upgradeable to 32 gbs which in the end is a pretty strong work horse upgrading it was a bit scary as its not under the keyboard you have to take the bottom off and use a thin of plastic guitar pick or ifixit to open it up go onto YouTube to watch a break down  its not to hard to upgrade batter life is not great but you could tailor it by having it turn off lights and lower screen brightness built in Bluetooth and full ethernet port 2 usb 3 ports and one usb c which brings me to my con and that is very little vr support I played vr games on a even older graphic card than this  and yet this RTX 3050 has no display port or a fast enough usb c to support an adapter I cant say about the quest but I have a rift s and it will not work on this laptop if you are looking for a mid workstation laptop this might fill the bill  if you are looking to get this for an artist going into school this one would be a good deal with the dedicated gpu this will extend the life of this computer to be able to handle most 3d and 2d applicationsProsgreat power for the costhas some room for upgradesok for 3d workok for gamingConslimited VR Supportbattery life is kind of short When I opened the laptop and plugged it in there was absolutely no activity  charging light did not turn on and laptop had no precharge After a panicky hour of trying to figure out what s wrong with my brand new very expensive laptop  and realizing how many one star reviews were here for this exact issue  I cannot stress this enough  SHOVE THE CHARGER IN It is VERY SNUG and you really REALLY have to push it hard There is a very significant click of the charger going in  and as soon as it did everything was fine Haven t used it yet  but wanted to update  as I now understand what all the one star reviews about this laptop being DOA are really about Happy gaming My son ask for this as a gift   we re in different countries  bought it and send to him only to know the part font fit  Don t buy 4m this site 79 processes and 41 of the ram out of the box Not going to be doing much gaming with this mess This is amazing quality for the price I am able to play any game I want at the highest speeds and metrics I haven t used the touch screen  but anticipate it would work just as well as everything else Very glad I went with this computer The laptop came dead on arrival No power and the charging indicator light also would NOT turn on The charger is working because I tested it on my other laptop Laptop itself is dead I m generally very pleased by this laptop but there are a few issues worth mentioning The trackpad is weirdly offset to the left for some reason instead of being in the center of the frame This means that whenever I have my left hand on WASD  the base of my thumb rests on the corner of the trackpad which then slightly adjusts the mouse whenever I have to press space or alt I don t play any games that would require this degree of precise aiming like FPS  because I suck at them but I imagine it would be infuriating if I did When I m alttabbing from a graphicsintensive game like dark souls 3 to a different program  the screen flashes black for a second Not really a major issue but it was slightly worrying at firstAside from that  performance is great  can t really speak to the battery life since I ve yet to use it while unplugged  but it s a powerful machine and I haven t had any issues with performance I have had the computer for a little over 2 months I m a mom so I don t get to use it as often as I would like However it runs my games smoothly even with mods added Loads content incredibly fast compared to my 4 year old computer I believe we ll be purchasing another one shortly for my husband as his computer is nearing the end of its life I would recommend this computer for sure Had the opportunity to grab this Nitro 5 10300H3050 for 699 The 4GB vram on the RTX3050 is a bummer but it s a brand new Ampere GPU with plenty of power for max 1080p gaming The 10th gen i5 CPU is a small beast A 1080p144hz screen with nice brightness With some little tweaks you can undervolt the CPU and overclock the GPU  upgrade the RAM to 16GB at least and you can squeeze a lot of more performance from this budget gaming laptop Very happy with this purchase I m sorry to say  but I am so disappointed They don t make things like they used toAfter having this laptop for some time I ve noticed some weird artifacting on the LCDSCREENSo  to explain  with night mode on or off you can see these rapidly moving lines that go through only certain colors like greys and blue s This is unacceptable It s very noticeable once you see it  and nothing software wise fixes it  so it s definitely a hardware problemI painfully had to make the decision to return this and I m very upset Need to push power cord until click heard I thought I got a dead laptop until I read a review in Spanish that pointed out that the power cord that plugs in to the back of the laptop needs to go in until an audible click is heard My son could not wait for this computer He uses it every day and loves it  Says it is the best and so happy His friend recommended this to him who know everything about computers probably can build his own My son loves all things technical so I trust him and says  get it  Never once complained about it He would say something the first day not a peep  This laptop is 100 worth the money I did a lot of research into many many different laptops  specifically in the 600900 range  and this was the one I went with And I m very glad I did I bought it mainly for gaming and it works like a charm Just some examples 150 FPS on Fortnite with high performance graphics  250 FPS on Rocket League with high performance graphics  300 FPS on Minecraft default 랁ancy graphics  200 FPS on Forza Horizon with high graphics I ve had absolutely no problems with it as far as gaming goes  and it works great for any daily work you may want to use it for Note that I did add an extra 8gb of crucial ram into the open slot  which does improve performance The only slight issue it has is that the fans can be a bit loud for more intensive games or programs However  that s the case for many budget gaming laptops Some good headphones will do the trick if it gets to be a problem But like I said  this laptop is exactly what I was looking for and if you re looking for a good gaming laptop in the 800 price range  this is it This is the first item I have ever returned from Amazon  as you have probably seen from other reviews  a common issue is the laptop will arrive simply not turning on or charging I was one of those people that ignored technical issues such as these because they have never happened to me That being said I would be careful with this one  it is packaged so loosely that it very likely bounced around during its shipping and knocked something important  when it arrived sure enough  didn t indicate a charge  simply did not turn on I would save your money  and get a gaming laptop from your local Best Buy instead Depending on what you re after  maybe even a prebuilt from your local Best Buy  or perhaps a more reputable website to order from Buyer beware Laptop arrived today  box was not damaged Unboxed it  plugged in the charger  pressed the power button and nothing Plug works and has other devices plugged inGaming laptop for 900 seemed to good to be true and it was bought for around 640  on black friday  what a dealthe laptop came and didnwt work I was so worried turns out  it was just the charger  and after replacing it works greatthe main thing I have to say isn t aabout the laptop but about amazonthey were so kind and proffesional with their help the momentit turns out to be a problem with the charger they ffer a full discount for the defective charger no trouble at all I took more time writing this review than explaining the problem and getting help from them if you want to buy latop from amazom I highly recommend it  and in Israel especially  much better service than the local companies and MUCH cheapernow for the latop itselfit is a capable laptop nothing to fancy or heavy  i bought the 1 5 10300H version with RTX 3050 PROprice  hardwareCONSthe screen is weird it hurts my eyes sometimes  and even thogh it is configured to 144 HZ  something doesn t add up not feel right checked several times  it is configured to 144 HZother than thatkeyboard fels cheap  and the cover is a cheap plasticthere was also the issues with the charger I saidoverall  for the price  I think it was a great choice for people who want a gaming beast or even just high quality laptop  this is not the place but if you want a capable cheap laptop I thinkfor the price it is quite a fair bargain I wish I could give this 5 starsDead on Arrival Returned 1 hour after opening Unlucky I guessThat said  it s a nice build and the weightform factor surprised meI have an Acer chromebook  so I do trust them for quality The return process is simplejust print label and drop it off at a UPS store Good luck to everyone So far the product has worked well however the power adaptor needs to be inserted and pushed all the way in and flush with the back of the laptop The images in the user manual are not accurate and thus can make the initial set up confusing  Before you return it please see if your ac adapter is pushed in all the way  May helpAcer  Please update your set up manual All it is a rev change with a new picture and release  This should reduce your calls about this issue My daughter order this gaming laptop on Thanks giving  I was happy but my happiness goes in drain  after plugin no lights laptop never work DOA dead on arrival I have told I cant reorder it because deal is 01 per customer nor I will get replacement  no other options except return It s been a few weeks  the machine has the following issues Runs extremely hot during games  performance will still drop to sub ten FPS or hang completely Alttabbing borderline lags outcrashes the machine USB ports on the left side fail to detect any and all new hardware  rendering the machine useless without a USB dock Sound coming out of the speakers is almost impossible to hear  so good luck watching videosmoviesetc without headphonesThe only good thing about this is the battery life  but since I spend most of my time with my machine plugged in because there s no way I ll be able to game on battery due to the performance drop battery life is useless to meThis is a very weak machine Get an Alienware or MSI if you want a higher quality product I ve seen Dell and HP laptops sell for 200 that can do more than this joke of a machine can If you want barebones that MIGHT be able to run some games Sure Purchase at your own risk  though  as USB failures seem to be a common ACER problem Great value for a baseline gaming laptop Added a 1tb storage M2  and dual rank memory FPS in Desriny2 went from 60ish to 90ish on average with less dipping Using Nvidia optimized settings and video to only use the graphics cardI have it sitting on an angled base to raise the screen and for better airflow Running the cooling in auto BIOS does not support XMP  and I not sure it is using the dual rank config but it runs as expected the picture of the box is how it arrived  no paddingreally I love the UHD larger 17  screen I bought this for business  so I knew I would need a gaming computer because it can handle large file sizes  highresolution vids that I want to do for business The large memory for viewing and building complex sites can slow down a computer  but with the high memory and storage and the operating system on an SSD drive  nothing slows down this beast My son just bought an ACER there seems to be a lot of value for the money compared to other brands I purchased the i510300HRTX3050 version of this laptopI was looking for a laptop with specific specs for under 1 000 and this checked all the boxesI wanted a 15inch laptop with an amazing looking screen with and IPS panel running at 144Hz and a decent GPU that could utilize itI ended up getting this laptop and adding a 500GB SSD additional storage and 8gb of Crucial RAM 8GB DDR4 3200 MHz to bump this up to 16GB total This ended up making the laptop much cheaper then buying one with that much ram and size of SSD in it on its ownThe way the heat is distributed on this laptop near the back by the screen keeps my wrists from burning up like I have had with prior laptopsThis thing has been able to run every game I play with at least 60fps on ultra settingsNew world ultra settings  around 6080fpsFF14 ultra settings  around 100 fps tbd the areaCall of duty medium settings  around 120 did this on purpose to take advantage of the higher refresh rateSmite Ultra settings  80 fpsThis laptop is hands down the best bang for your buck If you are really looking for a higher end laptop then your going to be spending between the 15002000 mark If you are trying to keep it under 1000 this was the best performance I was able to find for the price I m in love with this laptop I was looking for a review about running the sims 4 with a lot of packs but now that I have it  i ll say it This laptop runs the Sims 4 on Ultra graphics with all of the packs and tons of CC and mods BEAUTIFULLY It doesn t miss a single beat Loads in less than 30 seconds  and that s only with 8 gb of RAM The screen quality is so nice too  it looks like it has an overlay almost It starts up quickly  loads web pages super fast I can see myself thoroughly enjoying watching movies on this laptop even I don t know how it compares to other gaming or high end laptops  but if you re like me and you have a piece of crap laptop and you re used to it taking almost an hour to load the Sims on medium graphics  you will be BLOWN AWAY The laptop is super light and thin The keyboard has a nice feel to it  i like the back light but i wish you could change the color I played with it for 6 hours straight and the fans are super quiet  and it doesn t heat up that much at all It does slow down a little without being hooked up  but i don t plan on using it portably so I can t speak to that This was worth every penny  and I m really grateful for Acer packing so much power at a good price I don t see how it gets any better than this for little ol  me The unit arrived dead Plugged in the AC adapter firmly  checked cords  we had a second AC adapter of the same specs Power lights never lit up and the unit would not turn onI ordered a second one It just arrived and it game dead I have to send this one back now too Laptop did not turn on or recognize power source when plugged in Looks like a nice expensive paperweight The laptop was received in a large cardboard Box commaxe come up about twice the size of the product Box Possibly damaged during delivery because there was plenty of space to bounce around After looking at reviews it seems that this power issue is a common issue for this laptopDecided to purchase this laptop after my original pick was lost during delivery for almost a week and Amazon wanted me to pay an extra 100 after the price went up Customer service was not accommodating in the least The whole ordeal has been a major frustration and waste of time Will not be purchasing any big ticket items or electronics from Amazon again que bruto pongale 0 recibi la laptop hace un par de dias y me asuste mucho  porque no encendia  ni cargaba ni encendia ninguna luz la deje toda la noche conectada pensando que podia haber venido descargada de bateria  pero nada al dia siguiente ya estaba a punto de contactar a soporte para enviarla a garantia  y me puse a leer el manual cuya instruccion decia  al conectar el cargador asegurese de empujarlo hasta escuchar un clickahi estaba el fallo despues de conectarlo correctamente  encendio de una y hasta ahora vade maravillas I anticipate your questions  was the AC adapter plugged in correctly  was the outlet working I checked both several times  all fine  just no response from the battery charge light  no lights whatsoever  no charge  no startThis is directly after unboxing  btw  so it was incredibly disappointing to be shipped a 750 dollar paperweight I am in the process of getting my refund  and will never purchase an ACER again Good laptop  this i5 10300 H and RTX 3050 is a great combination add a extra stick of ram make sure it s 2933 and you should be okay I would suggest just buying a duel channel kit of Corsair vengeance  2933 just to make sure the ram dimms work together probably You can always add more storage later as Acer acutely advertises right on the laptop itself you can basically open it and add more at any time you see fit For games like WoW open world 89144 fps out questing PvP epic or random around a average in the 90s fps with mediumhigh settings can handle being upscaled in game to 1440p with a small performance hit But is great at 1080p seeing it s a smaller screen resolution  1080p looks amazing color is a tad lack luster but not a dealbreaker by any means at this price point does well with fallout series and other games as well I honestly did not expect this to perform as well as it does Honestly I think it s handles games just as well as a gtx 1070 or in at or right under 1660ti desktop version The 4GB v ram is not going to be able to handle ultra setting in most newer games but with the smaller screen turning down certain settings are going to get you great performance With almost no visual quality loss I would take higher refresh rate over higher resolution any day certain games you may not be able to achieve the 144hz but anything over 60 is going to stay buttery smooth You will have one extra nvme ssd slot under the one in use I do believe that can handle up to a 2TB drive and a 25 sata drive slot as well I Iiked it so much my girlfriend wanted a laptop and I couldn t justify buying anything less even though she only plays sims 4 I can t bring myself to buy anything in the 600 to 700 range that only runs on integrated graphics it s just not worth the money Like a moth to a flame I was mesmerized by the value and great review ratings and I ignored the fact that there are at least SIX REVIEWS IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS saying their machine like mine wouldn t even turn on Most stores would recognize this as a problem but Amazon shamefully just keeps selling this junk This was in my house 3 hours before I got my money back along with arrangements for them to pick up the craptop at my door to return it I will find another non Acer laptop  and I will buy it from somewhere other than Amazon There has to be a price to pay for knowingly selling defective productsEDIT Just want to address the 랓ou have to press the charger plug in extra hard comments from other reviews Imagine you buy a brand new car and the dealer tells you that you need to use extra force when you close your door otherwise it will stay open and the car won t run Are you going to be ok with that Not me And even if that s the issue  why didn t support know it when I talked to them Also why is the battery at zero  therefore requiring the charger to power up My replacement MSI worked perfectly right out of the box I love this laptop  I push my laptop pretty hard  I use Blender  Daz3d and a few other software s for 3d modeling and rendering this laptop can handle it pretty well with blender cycles I could do optiX gpu rendering in Daz Studio I was able to get a decent render using Nivdia iray with

work horse upgrading it was a bit scary as its not under the keyboard you have to take the bottom off and use a thin of plastic guitar pick or ifixit to open it up go onto YouTube to watch a break

for the price The only thing that needs improvement is the sound quality doesn t get loud at all and very low quality speakers overall Unit came in broken Won t power on Bought this computer and was sent one that was dead on arrival Filed a complaint and requested a new one  same thing dead on arrival Terrible quality control  would love to write an actual review for the product but it s been over a month and I still have yet to get sent a laptop that turns on Battery when gaming is an hour tops This is a nice laptop with good keyboard and screen but Battery life when gaming really sucksIf plugged in it has good performance for a 3050 laptop Supposed to be a gift for my gf Got 1 and didnt power up Got a replacement SAME ISSUE QC is awful on this produce Would not turn on I plugged in and no charging lights either Tried multiple plugs on house and push power button many times as well my daughter was so disappointed was her Christmas gift This laptop arrived dead Multiple reviews have stated their laptop arrived dead as well Don t waste your time with this I tried charging through 3 different outlets and still nothing Returning and refunding Tech support was very helpful in making my return and refund Again do not waste your time with this Acer Nitro 5 laptop It should be taken off the Amazon site as a whole This computer can handle everything you throw at it  I got the RTX 3050 version for 800  but I highly recommend that you upgrade the devices RAM  to get the best out of the Graphics Card I will be doing that very soon  myself You can also upgrade the SSD with two of them including a hard drive as well  I highly recommend you guys buy this computer it is totally worth it  if you are interested in serious gaming The cpu is 25ghz  but it has 45ghz turbo So I am happy It shows 42ghz on task manager and I tested doom and got steady 120hz I upgraded with another 8gb ram and 1tb ssd for only about another 100 so for around 900 I am very happy with this purchase The media could not be loaded \\xa0Perfecta perfecta perfecta sin m치s que agragar  vivo en rep칰blica Dominicana y pens칠 que la pc seria muy mala opci칩n comprarla pero me facina todo lo de ella excelente As a gaming computer my son rates this 5 out of 5 for this price point The laptop works well  runs smoothly My son uses this laptop primarily for games It has a great read and write speed when downloading games or files The games run smoothly  modern warfare  etc The hard drive space is good for the average person  but if you want to have multiple files and games you ll need an external drive The biggest plus is the battery port in the back  which is way easier to use than the side ports a lot of laptops have Overall this computer works well for the price  less than 900 The only complaint is that the fan gets loud and gets hot if you do anything intensive  which is a issue most laptops unfortunately have I am admittedly a little new to the pc gaming world  but this seems to pack a punch The battery lasts incredibly long on a single charge so it s nice for taking to a friends house  or traveling Even when off the charger the whole machine runs so quickly it feels instantaneous  no lag at all I was extra impressed that you can have multiple tabs or windows running at the same time  and switch between what is minimized with no errors Again  I am newer to this  so maybe I am na칦ve  but online games take a lot of processing power to run with no hitches and this seems to work perfectlyI personally like the red back light on the keys  but can look a little ominous when you re in the dark haha The back light does go away once you stop typing for 30 seconds or so The only other hitch is that the fans are loud The are cooling down a machine that is working hard  so it makes sense  but I would recommending headphone of some kind to block that out Great for this new gamer that uses it for regular email and work functions as well as online games I was on the lookout for a new laptop for video editing The big thing that attracted me to this model was the GeForce RTX 3050 video cardThe configuration I ordered was a bit light on RAM and hard drive space  so I ended up upgrading to 32 GB of low latency RAM and adding an additional 256 GB SSD driveThe big win for me was the performance gains I got in video rendering On my old machine  the rendering could take anywhere from 2060 minutes  depending on video size Generally  most rendering on this laptop takes less than 5 minutes I can t even calculate how much time this new laptop has saved meRating 5 stars Highly recommended Great laptop for the price Will run any game you throw at it with no problems Some extremely demanding games will be limited to high settings instead of ultra because of the 4gb of VRAM However if you re gaming on the laptop screen it s very hard to perceive any difference between mediumhigh and ultra settings because of the pixel density of a 1080p 156  displayI highly recommend adding more storage and another 8gb of RAM to get the most out of this laptop If you re uncomfortable doing that then look for a model with more storage and 16gb of RAM from the manufacturerFor advanced users  I highly recommend changing the thermal paste to something better 1015C temperature drops can be had Also leaving the power plan on  Balanced  and enabling coolboost in the Nitrosense application will help keep temperatures at acceptable levelsProsRuns 99 of games smooth as silk Unless you hit vram limit  you re looking at 60fps or above with high settingsRTX 3050 has current gen tech like DLSS that will extend the life of the laptopKeyboard is a huge improvement over the last gen modelLaptop overall is a sleeker  more streamlined design over the last gen model Less wasted space  smaller bezels and weighs lessMuch better cooling solution than previous models RTX 3050 never breaks 70C after changing thermal pasteThe display is nice Deep blacks and vivid colors but with some drawbacks at this price point 144hz is also an excellent additionConsSpeakers are absolutely terribleScreen has absurd levels of backlight bleedThe laptop runs HOT without changing the thermal paste Even on Acer s  balanced  power plan the CPU was hitting upwards of 90C and throttling After changing the paste it runs around 6772C consistently while gaming10300H still has good enough performance for most games today but being a quad core it will soon struggleOverall it s about what you would except from a laptop at this price point I can see why some people will say it runs hot It does need some slight tweaking to get the most from it and not have it melt in your lap It s a solid performer though I ve tried games like Escape From Tarkov  Red Dead Redemption 2  Monster Hunter World  Halo Infinite  and Forza Horizon 5 Haven t had a single issue Normally I game on my 3700X2070S desktop but this is a very acceptable compromise for more portable gaming The lap top is working as expected  with 800 USD you were able to get a 3050 GPU  which is good for most light duty game like CS go  DOTA2  etc Which is good enough for me Unlike those ultra book  this one has slot RAM and can be upgrade to like 32GB and another stat HDD slot  but they don t include cable and socket I believe you d have to do some research how to solid one It looks like a good deal for light gamer This lap top is junk do not buy I ve had this nitro 5 for 1 year and the mother board is toast Tried to contact acer and they told me it was out of warranty This lap top maybe had a weeks worth of use and it s already junk Don t go cheap buy American Never ever settle for an i5 cpu especially in a laptop It seems like a good deal but it s not every gaming laptop should at least have an i7 if they want it to be worth buying L 1 It sound like a 747 getting ready to take off whenever you even think about opening anything2 Always freezes after 2 or so minutes into a game and will either stay this way until you shut it off or just shut off and require a battery reset3 Battery resets are apparently a part in owning this thing considering I have to do it after like 2 minutes into a game It s alright  runs current games on medium settings The storage HDD on mine died after just over a year For a laptop this small and lightweight  I m surprised at the performance it carries What an incredible piece of tech Bad experience The battery life isn t great but other than that it s great Make sure that you push the charger cord in the back of the computer until you hear a click or it won t charge I dislike the battery they need to fix it that s all You can upgrade some of the internal components for a better experience Pretty cheap in terms of laptops didn t charge or turn on at all Everything is according to the seller  but you have to forcefully push the power adapter all the way in Buena compra  su relacion precioproducto es 45 It s for my son  he is a beginner developer and avid gamer  this laptop meets his needs 100 This computer is awesome Only issue is low storage space but the computer came with an adaptor chord Charger didn t work so i couldn t even start up the laptop Might not happen to you  person reading this but it will be annoying if it does grate speed fantastic graphics Save yourself the time and buy something else I thought I d try my luck against the reviews Sadly they proved to be correct Don t buy The AC port did not fit Great entry level gaming pc It runs great able to run some big games at a good fps but storage and ram is a bit on the low side other than that if it new to PC and don t know what to get this is ur best choice My husband and I got this for his big Christmas present He loves it and has been on it since before Christmas everyday I asked him how does he like it and he says it runs great for the games he plays Not sure what games but they cost money lol It slowed down tremendously after one week of use  and I only downloaded ONE game It s a computer So on Christmas morning I thought it was DOA However  you really have to push in the power cord into the back of it computer There is a noticeable click If you do not hear the click then it will not charge This laptop is great for gaming I ve had it for about 5 months now and have no complaints Very little lagsometime it does but it s not the laptop Decent laptop for gaming Runs everything at 144 Fps on external screen I m talking GTA on high settings I ve been in the pro scene of gaming on Xbox and this delivers for comp gameplay Siege 200 Fps Fortnite 300Fps GTA 144 Fps Warzone 100 Fps Valorant 400Fps Runs VR great aswell This is a great pickup for gaming but the storage drive is a little lacking at 256 gigs I play rdr2  Fortnite  csgo  halo infinite  etc just fine at regular settings  haven t tried to push it too much settings wise but I m fine with the regular settings on the games and they run good  no lag The fan can be loud but I wear headphones and after a little bit you barely notice it Ordered 2 of these for my boys for Christmas just to open them up and find that both were dead and no matter what I did  they would not charge Save your money Just like many I had issues with the charging cord뵥ut I kept reading reviews and found someone who said to push until it snaps into the laptop뵤nd it worked I ve never had a laptop that plugged in that hard but it is perfect for my gaming son He loves it If you re looking for something that can play most modern AAA titles at medium or low  this is IT Slap another 8gb of ram and some storage in this thing under 140 and its an amazing budget laptop for the price It also includes a free month of game pass and an upgrade to win 11 It s awesome I love it Got this a week ago and can I say  I didn t expect the RTX 3050 in here to be this good It has a low TDP I suggest getting more storage and ram It will vastly improve your experience with the machine ZERO STARS  They delivered the wrong laptop I ordered the Acer Nitro and got a Lenovo Chromebook WTF Acer produces cheapest computers The low price comes from cheap chips Still worth to buy if want to save money Me and my husband decided to get this laptop as he needed a more powerful PC for his old Macbook used for web development and programming and I wanted to have something that we could use to game with on the go None of us have bought a new laptop in many many years  let alone a gaming laptop vs a business oriented laptop or budgetlightweight laptop This seemed like a great compromise between new techhardware  easily upgradable in terms of ram  and something that wasn t super super flashy or expensive We ve never had a PC with some of this hardware on it but we both were familiar with it in any case We both spent the last two months with it to get an idea of the feel for this laptop in different use cases and so onI checked and the machine had the latest bios and firmware  which was a great sign I decided to run some basic benchmarks and get a feel for it in Windows before wiping it and putting Linux on it One thing I ran into right off the bat was that I wasn t used to the laptop cable being a bit confusing to use It will look like it s in all the way but you usually have to push in a little bit more It s sturdy in both cases but it s confusing as it can seem sturdily in but you always have to push it in a bit more When I first was using the laptop I had a bit of a heart attack thinking it was DOA but it s just that you need to push the adapter alll the way in I ve never had a newer gaming laptop before so I was surprised the power brick is 180w It s not super bulky or anything for its power output but keep it in mind if you have 랏niversal laptop adapters or want to get a new one  that a 90w may work for every day use but you may run down on gamingetc The screen is nice and bright  an IPS screen  but there was something I just couldn t put my finger on  that made it seem like something was 랇acking for a gaming PC screen It wasn t bad at all but I ve had really nice monitors and something just felt a little off My husband on the other hand thought the the 144 Hz display was very crisp and great  other than being a bit dim on BIOS and boot  but then picking up to be crisp and he appreciated the fulltrue HD on this model He s more of the design guy so I ll defer to that Here are some of the stats I got from running a few things on Windows and checking the fan app Nitrosense The Geekbench CPU test in terms of temp was around 5861 and had short peaks at 7269 towards the end peak at max fan while watching with Nitrosense These are more than reasonable numbers for CPU temps As an aside  I would have preferred that this had an AMD chip versus the fiasco that is Intel s 10th gen mobile chip on outdated 14nm architecture but for our purposes it s just an annoyance vs anything that would affect performance Geekbench gave a score of 1004 single core 2869 multi core  which is quite a bit lower than expected with that CPU so maybe I take the previous statement back  though  hah I m cheap so I used 3dmark11  here are the results for that Graphics score 17531  Physics core 7811  Combined score 8038After all that I decided to nuke Windows and to put Manjaro Linux on it This is the one area I ran into an issue with and am actually deducting a star just for this I got it to work in the end but I m really shocked that Acer would make things this user unfriendly given what I knew of them as a company up until now and am worried this trend will continue There are a couple of basic annoying things about the bios that you ll have to enable for Linux First off a bunch of stuff is grayed out unless you set a bios password which is infuriating to me Set a junk bios password and then make sure to enable f12 boot option and disable fast boot just in case any issues crop up  I didn t run into them but after Googling around I didn t want to take any chances and it was probably smart to be prepared after the second nightmare I ran into뵈nyway  if you try to install any form of Linux  you ll get a message that there s no hard drive available Why Well  this laptop comes with one NVME drive with an M2 storage chip There s some terrible secret bios setting on by default which makes this drive s interface Intel Rapid Storage or RST only  which is some horrible proprietary Intel thing where supposedly you can make use of RAM to get more performance  I don t know  but in any case with this enabled there is no backwards compatibility on a standard ACHI interface I didn t see the option in bios and was devastated that I may just have to install a standard SSD However  it turns out there is a 랍ecret option in bios You have to press Ctrl  S in the main screen  and then go a tab over and a secret option to change the hard drive mode from RST to ACHI is there Once you change that everything is fine but there should be no secret bios option and I am terrified that upon updating bios this will be removed and that I ll forget the lame password I had to put JUST to change some simple options The most awful bios I ve seen recently and it s a really bad look for AcerA couple of weeks of using it and we decided to upgrade to 32GB of ram which is one of the main reasons we got this model The laptop begins with one stick with 8 GB and gives you an extra slot  so if you want to upgrade from 8 GB it s really nice that you don t have to buy a whole new set of RAM  you can just buy another 8 GB stick or add whatever you might already haveThe laptop is considerably faster than my husband s Macbook 2015 when running my development environment and build tools He runs development in a VirtualBox environment which is resource intensive but has no issues and everything runs fast It runs a nodejs and nginx server in that environment  plus nodejs build scripts which are also resource intensive but has no issues with these eitherWe also have no issues running games on SteamWine with Linux although we are not hardcore gamers we tried some MMOs we liked versus the indie games we usually do which don t need this kind of power  and were able to put them at max setting and they looked beautiful Still have to break in the gaming stuff a bit more but no issues with Wine and the video card on linux at all  I can recommend Linux gaming for all  in some cases the games run faster and betterThe keyboard is backlit but has function keys to dim the backlight until it turns off  in case the light bothers you There is also a function key to turn the screen on and off which is useful to do when I leave the laptop idling when I step away from itIncluded are some pictures of the RAM install The inside is very very nicely organized and extremely easy to navigate There is also an extra HD slot as well as an extra slot for adding another M2 storage chip The laptop comes with one M2 chip alreadyWhen we start to do resource intensive tasks the fans start to get a bit noisy but nothing out of the ordinary The fans are doing a good job because I have not noticed any lag or slowing down even when they re working furiously We did notice one time where the laptop flashed the caps lock key after shutting down and wouldn t boot immediately but booted again later  we assumed maybe it had overheated a bit and it turns out that was the case contacted Acer as well and they confirmed it Only happened once so glad actually the thermals were protecting themselvesOverall we re very happy with this laptop It did turn out as being a great compromise between something that would have been too flashy and expensive but gave us a lot of power and especially the ability to upgrade for dev tasks and gaming while on the go Other than the bios issue  nothing stood out to us as annoying or even really any cons It feels really quite portable for a gaming laptop and although the styleform is obviously a gaming laptop it s subtle It s a great value performance laptop that s easy to upgrade  but Acer  quit your BIOS shenanigans  UPDATE 8132020  I updated drivers  and RTX 3050 is now running 5865 FPS on Ultra  and 9398 FPS on High settings I must have needed an update  this is a legitimate gaming Laptop I picked up the Acer Nitro 5 to play Elder Scrolls Online ESO remotely when I travel or take road trips with my wife During my first few days of use  I was only getting about 30fps at 1080p at medium settings Just as I made peace with this  I installed a driver update and a windows update  and I started to get the legitimate 60FPS 5 that I was originally expectingAs a laptop  the Acer Nitro 5 is great It loads fast  and put on an older version of Office 2013 that I own from the old Microsoft HUP Home User Program that let employees get a neverexpiring license for 995 if their company owned it at work For most desktop use  the PC is snappy and works as fast as my i5 Surface Book 4As a gaming laptop  I m happy now that the a software update I have no idea which one brought me the performance I was expecting The RTX 3050 can indeed pull 60 frames per second fps with Ultra on a game like Elder Scroll Online that was released in 2014 7 years ago At High settings  it even gets a respectable 9398 FPS with tweaks to individual settings like shadow qualityI play most of the huge franchise games Fallout  CyberPunk  Elder Scrolls  Far Cry  Witcher  Watch Dogs  Assasin s Creed  Crysis  Dead Island  Dying Light  Saints Row  The Crew  Need for Speed  Bioshock  Borderlands  etc I have a RTX 3080 system hooked up to an 85in TV where I play 4k Gaming in the evenings  and I have a slightly older Dual GTX 1080 SLI desktop system in my office that I use for 2k1440p gamingI picked up ESO Elders Scrolls Online for the first time about 2 months ago  and I wanted to be able to login from the road for daily rewards and to play a few hours before going to bedThe 256Gb Hard Drive was large enough to hold the ridiculous 180Gb install for ESO  and the built in Bluetooth works perfectly with my 3rd party  Microsoft xbox One  style controllerI was initially disappointed when I blindly launched the game with default settings and was only getting 2428FPS I tried to get Geforce Experience to launch to recommend  Optimal Settings   but I could not get it to load Again  after some searching I learned that GForce Experience is buggy and nobody really uses it I guess I ve just always been lucky A week later  I was thrilled when I launched and started getting the frame rates I initially expectedAs I attempted to understand the initial low frame rates  I went out to check the Passmark settings for RTX3050 on videocardbenchmarknet That s where I discovered my error I d thought an RTX 3050 would be in a similar class to my RTX 3080 which I use for 4k gaming The RTX 3050 is a mobile card with a passmark score of about 9 286For reference  the performance of the RTX 3050 mobile in this laptop is akin to an old GeForce GGTX 780 TI 9 165  GTX 1060 9 870  Radeon Pro 5600m 10 484  GTX 1060 TI mobile 10 176 or GTX 1070 Mobile 10 465As it turns out  it CAN pull down decent frame rates at 1080p With the fans going rather high  but oh well I wouldn t put this to 2k or 4k gaming uses on an external monitor though The RTX3050 Mobile s passmark score of 9 286 is nowhere near a GeForce RTX 3060 TI 19 755  RTX 3070 21 873  or RTX 3080 24 404 So  you have to be reasonableOverall  I am happy with the laptop The price was reasonable The game play experience is smooth now that all my updates and patches are installedAs of my 3rd week of ownership 8132021  I m a happy camper TL DR The Acer Nitro 5 AN5155553E5 Gaming Laptop is an entrylevel gamingcapable computer Its outofthebox specs are underwhelming  but some can be upgraded  like RAM and hard drive space The RTX 3050 is the cheapest house in the fancy neighborhood It s a solid starter GPU for current games  but temper your frame rate and detail expectations The Comet Lake i5 CPU is capable  but can run hot Get used to the fans Don t pay more than MSRP  given you ll need to fork out some extra money on ram and another SSD to meet basic storage needsForm  BuildThe Nitro 5 is a big computer  but not so big that you couldn t put it in a backpack and take it with you to a friend s place Do people still have LAN parties Good times The heavily plastic build keeps the weight down  but contributes to some questionable points of quality For instance  pressing on the top of the lid when closed  there s a lot of give This can absorb impact if you drop itfeels like it could crack under the wrong force The semigloss surfaces inside and out do pick up oils from the skin that are hard to get off and show as shiny spotsThere are some good input options  with 3 standard USB ports and a USB C port There s an ethernet port  too  as well as an HDMI output and a headphonemic jack The only port on the rear of the unit is the power jack  which is sort of awkwardly placed right in the middle  rather than off to the side There is no Displayport outputThe fan can get quite loud to keep the unit cool The CPU heats up  especially when gaming The bottom of the computer stays relatively cool  thanks to the fans and ventilation to the rear and sides  but parts of the keyboard can get pretty warm You can monitor CPU and GPU temperatures in the NItro app There s even a hotkey for it top left of the number padKeyboard  Touchpad and ScreenThe keyboard is wellsized It s nice to have a full number pad The keys have good travel they re quiet and have solid feedback Some of the keys are oddly sizedplaced  like the right shift key  to make more room for the arrows and the number pad The number pad has standard sized keys The red backlighting can be adjusted for brightness  but not for color unless there is some software controller that I haven t been able to find yet It can t be changed in the Lenovo Vantage or Nitro app The texture of the keys feels slightly rubberized  but smooth without being slippery Trackpad is smooth and responsive It s a decent size  but I d be comfortable with something a little larger You ll probably be using a mouse for gaming anywayThe screen is okay I like that it is slightly elevated with a larger bezel to the bottomthis makes it feel a little larger than it is and gives a better viewing angle The matte finish is good for reducing glare However  visually  it s a bit washed out Blacks and whites have a slight grayness to them and the screen never seems quite as bright as it could be Make good use of that HDMI output and hook up to your favorite fullsized monitorPerformanceGaming performance on the Nitro 5 is good enough for a lot of games If you re looking for a decent laptop to play League of Legends  WoW or Final Fantasy 14 with your friends  this one will definitely work If you want to dominate in League  destroy your foes in PVP or need super high frame rates and detail for streaming you might want to invest in something with higher specs  even with the upgradeability of this PCThe factory SSD works really well Games and programs load fast  starting up Windows after sleephibernateshutdown is a breeze The Nvidia Experience app will automatically optimize game settings based on your hardware  or you can manually tweak certain things based on your play style  which is really great You can monitor resource use and temperatures using the Nitro appMy current games of choice are World of Warcraft Shadowlands 2020 and Code Vein 2019 I ve had to turn detail down a bit in both games for the sake of framerate  but they both still run very well In WoW  I m at mediumhigh custom settings graphics slider is at 7  with some settings turned down a little lower  like spell effects  ground cover and water detail I m getting 6080 fps depending the number of other players in an area Code Vein is almost maxed out settingswise I turned down distancedetail and turned off ray tracing to improve framerates and responsivenessDownload speeds are pretty impressive A lot can depend on clientside factors battlenet has much slower download speeds than Steam  for instance  but on Steam  I ve been averaging 50mbs or about 34 GBmin  which is nothing to sneeze at Glad I installed another hard drive to install those games onUpgradingYou only get 8GB of RAM and a 256 GB SSD on this computer out of the box These are the most lackluster specs but  these are also the things you can upgrade I successfully doubled my usable hard drive space by adding a cheap 240GB 25in SATA SSD into the open bay There is also an OPEN RAM slot You can slip an 8GB stick right into that open slot to double the ram or replace the ram and add more with 2x16 for a max of 32GB  which should speed up your overall performance quite a bit  especially if you do a lot of multitasking These are  of course  going to be additional expenses  but not all laptops these days allow for this kind of upgradeability and the flexibility to make changes later as you get a feel for what your needs are Hardware for adding a 25in drive is included in the box with the laptop  and there are stepbystep instructions for adding a new hard drive and RAM on the ACER support website that were very helpful They did not  however  include the software stuff you ll need to know if you ve never added a hard drive before After installing the new drive  search for how to get Windows to recognize the new hard drive You ll need to go into the system manager to initialize  format and assign a letter to your new drive before you can use it I spent several weeks with this laptop before sitting down to review it My conclusions are that for the pricepoint asked for it  which incidentally is less than what it was when it first arrived at my place  it s well worth the money The graphics card delivers images and a gaming experience as good as machines I have that costs several hundred dollars more than this one For me this the essential feature of a gaming laptop and this one passes that test with flying colors My most demanding games performed without glitches  sputtering or any of the other problems that arise from inadequate graphics functionality Speed on gaming and all other activities on this device leave nothing to complain about The screen here provides crisp  clear images  another plus for demanding gaming in which partly hidden features during play need to be identified and engaged Conversely  however  the sound card could be better This card can deliver uneven soundeffects when gaming  though it s fine for watching movies or streaming RAM can be upgraded though I see no need to do so at this point The casing for this device is strong even though this machine is thinner and sleeker than my other gaming laptops  so much so that I d feel comfortable using it in a business setting something I would not do with my other gaming machines which look too much like they re designed for fun and games rather than a professional environment This is a very fast and responsive piece of equipment  essential for a good gaming experience and something I would want anyway from any computer My bottom line is that you get an exceptional bargain with this machine priced at just under 900 as of this writing in late July 2021 I d definitely recommend it for those looking for a good gaming device capable of handling demanding play at a more affordable price In the  almost touching four figures  range  there are a lot of surprisingly good gaming laptops coming onto the market from different manufacturers Assuming each one was available  you d be spoiled for choice this summer Decent processors  nice midrange RTX GPU s  and at least a certain degree of expandability should be expectedAcer s Nitro 5 is well  not great Personally  when I think Acer  I think  budget  And there s nothing wrong with budget systems and components I m quick to recommend Acer to people on a tight budget who are looking for entrylevel laptops Their stuff isn t toptier  but is usually fine for what you pay Few of us have infinite dollars to spend on computers Though Acer tends to make their products feel like they re not quite as good as everything else  and the Nitro 5 is no exception hereCase in point at the time of this writing  another hundred bucks or so gets you the\\xa0 Lenovo Legion 5  And for that hundred dollars  you get build quality that makes the Nitro feel kind of flimsy  you get a processor that absolutely trounces the comparatively anemic i5 10300H  twice the RAM  twice the storage space  an ARGB keyboard  and a faster refresh rate on the displayAll that  for a hundred bucks Give or takeSo  is that a testament to Lenovo giving you an incredible value  or Acer not being up to par YesHaving both systems sidebyside  it highlights so many places where Acer could have delivered  but cheaped out When you delve into what you re getting with the Nitro 5  everything about it feels like you took the cheapest thing on the shelf From the very beginning  you need to dedicate nearly an hour out of the box just for Windows updates that Acer didn t add to their shipping image And not because of a slow connection I was hitting in the neighborhood of 800 megabits over 80211ax but you can feel how constricted the system really is with that i5 and only 8 gigs to work withOnce you ve got your Windows updates set  you have to navigate the sea of bloatware that Acer loaded the Nitro 5 up with No  I don t want Express VPN No  I don t want Dropbox No  I don t want your weird app store No  I don t want your whatever this password manager thing is that I ve never heard of No  I don t want And it hits you that while you d wading through all of this junk  Acer thought it would be good to put their system update software other than in the Acer folder It s kind of a head scratcherAll the while  the bottom of the laptop gets scorching hot Yeah  a gaming laptop without a great vapor chamber is going to get toasty  but again  it s one of those areas where Lenovo figured out how to make efficient heat pipes that make the Legion 5 bearable Why didn t AcerSo I moved on Let s get 3DMark and PCMark on here  and see how it compares And even that produced a  Go home  Acer You re drunk  kind of emotion Load up 3DMark  and it says  Hey  you ve got an i5  and I see this RTX 3050 over here  and then it barfs at the end saying that it couldn t quite figure out what you have I installed official GeForce drivers  uninstalled and reinstalled 3DMark  and still got the same  This isn t official because reasons  message But don t take my word for it Check out the pictures I ve attachedSo the results  while not  official  tell a pretty interesting story about what a hundred bucks more gets you As you can see  these are the Acer Nitro 5 against the Lenovo Legion 5 While 3DMark is calling the GPU  Generic VGA   you can see for yourself that the specs are correct for a 3050 dGPU and are too high to be the iGPU from the i5 But they re also 1618 apartFor perspective s sake the difference between the Nitro 5 and the Legion 5 is 100 points greater than the difference between the Legion 5 and my desktop Ryzen 9 5900X with an RTX 3080 GPU And again  you can see that the dGPU is running at full frequency Even if you re thinking  Oh  this dude is a total Lenovo shill  and the results don t have approved drivers  and I m an internet detective and blah  blah  blah  look at the CPU scores There s no CPU driver And it isn t like Acer or Lenovo are like  Yeah  go hog wild with settings for undervolting and underclocking in our expansive BIOS features  on either systemIn my review of the Legion 5  I took it apart and ran PC Mark  and dug deeper into it because I couldn t believe how much power you were getting for the price But with the Nitro 5  I didn t see much point The moment you try to slap more RAM into it  you re at the same price point It would cost you more to bring just the RAM and NVMe drive to the same specs as the Legion 5  and you d still have a slower computer with a slower refresh rate  worse warranty  inferior build quality  middling keyboard  and terrible heat management I m  late  to the game pun intended with my review as there are already a few very complete and competent ones before mine I agree with just about everything there  so I ll just add a few of my own thoughtsI kinda like the fact that this came with a reasonable  yet perhaps slightly underwhelming  set of components to get you started The fact that they included the cable and bracket for a 25  drive in the box is awesome That says to me  Listen  we know you re gonna want more storage eventually We didn t include it to keep the cost of entry down  but here s the parts you ll need to make it happen  The bottom cover is easy to take off to get at the drives and RAM  which also could use an upgrade when you re ready This is all appealing to me so Acer did good in this departmentThe laptop has a slight  cheap plastic  feel to it But it s not so bad that you re afraid to move or use it It s just not made from premium materials  but that doesn t mean it s not built well The keyboard is a little mushy to type on  and I kinda wish they hadn t chosen to cram in the number pad on the side  because this makes the key spacing and arrangement a little uncomfortable I know this is a gaming laptop  but sometimes one needs to type on it too I found the red light to be a bit much in a dark room  but the brightness is adjustable so that s fine The screen is passable There s a pretty significant amount of backlight bleed on dark screens  but when playing a game that fills the screen with bright colors  it s more than fine Speaking of the colors  they re not perfect but are good enough at this price  in my opinion One cool thing that I haven t seen mentioned anywhere is that the cooling fans have red lights in them These can be faintly seen from the rear vents when the ambient light is low enough A nice touch that is relatively unseen  but cool to know it s thereAs for performance  I tested it with Forza Horizon 4  the only game I own currently  and it did fine The automatic profile didn t have everything cranked up  but the game still looked beautiful to my eyes There was no stuttering or tearing that I saw and it got 72 fps The laptop handled all  regular  computing tasks with ease The included combination of CPU  RAM and SSD all seem to work well together for an enjoyable computing experience That being said  I did do a clean install of Windows 10 to get rid of the small amount of bloatware that came with it It seemed to be a little less bogged down after that  but it honestly wasn t too bad to begin withThat s about all I ve got to say about it Overall  I think it s a fine choice for the casual  budgetminded gamer It comes equippedenough to get you started and has room to be even better without breaking the bank all at once Huge points for the RAM not being soldered  a current trend and big pet peeve of mine And the rest of the system s not bad either I know Acer is considered a  lesser  brand than some of the other big ones  but I think they did alright here The Nitro series from Acer is their budget line of gaming laptops Tucked away in this line are some hidden gems and very capable laptops able to handle your gaming needs Is the Acer Nitro 5 up to task Hopefully this full review will answer all your

engine  World of WarcraftShadowlands will give your CPU and GPU a fairly decent workout Framerates weren t maxed but with details at Ultra 10 max setting and Raytracing set to max I was still netting very playable framerates ranging from 5090 Checking with MSI Afterburner  my GPU was 99100 utilized at all times while my CPU utilization was around 50 which means I was GPU boundI ran a few gaming benchmarks too for comparison Futuremark s Timespy netted 4798 which is right in line with the average score of 4800 for the RTX 3050 Mobile This means the 3050 is 13 faster than a desktop 1060 with all the added extras features of 3000 series RTX GPUsBENCHMARKS AND THERMALSWhile stress testing  benchmarking the CPU and GPU never overheated and fans didn t hit max If you like  Acer includes a custom control center called Nitro Sense that will allow you to boost your cooling or manually turn fans to max for the ultimate in cooling During gaming  I did not need headphones The fans are most certainly there but nowhere near what I ve experienced with other gaming notebooksI tested the CPU with Cinebench 23 and it never heat throttled achieving a very respectable score of 5592 multi and 1100 single with a max temp of 86 with fans at max and 93c with fans on autoI tested the GPU with Timespy and Superposition and it never throttled with a max temp of 60cWhen gaming  both CPU and GPU are working and being cooled in tandem and temps for the CPU maxed at 85 and GPU at 78 after a few hours of gaming with fans not hitting max The power supply definitely gets warm to the touchBLOATWAREI ve used a few Acer laptops before and the extra programs were not that bad but this time around that is not the case The system felt slightly laggy and unresponsive versus as how a new install should feel The system had so much installed and so much going on that checking how many programs were installed said 85 As a test  I did a clean install and updated everything and installed all the drivers and Nitro Sense and that dropped to 51 That means there were at least 34 extra programsevents installedDISPLAYThis is easily the weakest point of the Acer Nitro Yes it is a 144hz panel  but this panel is not the greatest The Nitro series uses the Panda NCP004D This panel has only 62 sRGB and 43 AdobeRGB coverage It is quickly noticeable the color space is bad as the reds are a washed out deep orange and blues are pale GTG response time is 41ms It actually has decent brightness and contrast with an acceptable black level  but the poor colors and especially bad response time will be unacceptable to some hardcore gamers For most gamers  it will be a non issue I was actually ok with the response times as I m not  hardcore   but it was the immediate lack of pop and washed out colors that caught my eye My panel had a lot of backlighting ghosting in both bottom corners when dark Most IPS panels have blacklighting and ghosting in at least one corner or more It is just to what degreeSOUNDThe speakers were surprisingly very respectable You re not going to get some deep bass or amazing seperation  but they were more than passable when playing games or viewing videos  listening to music They were easily able to outpace the fans when gamingMEMORY AND STORAGE8GB is not going to cut it anymore While playing WoW and using MSI Afterburner to measure my usage  my system was using almost 7GB for gaming alone The 8GB is upgradeable as the system has 2x SODIMM slots with one occupied with a single 8GB DDR4 3200 module running at 2933 which at the least needs another module for dual channel mode and extra gaming breathing room This really should be the first thing you do to lift your system performance Companies selling gaming notebooks need to start offering them with 16GB as standard256GB is about the baseline for storage for a gaming notebook as games are pretty massive these days Luckily  the Nitro has a full 25  drive bay so you can either upgrade the primary storage or just install a nice  juicy 25  250GB to 4TB SSD in there and you will have plenty of room for extra games and storageFINAL THOUGHTSAfter using the Acer Nitro  I have to say I like it While the smaller storage and single channel 8GB only memory may be an issue for some  the memory and storage deficiencies can be overcome by upgrading it to exactly what you need if the initial configuration does not fit the bill I REALLY like the keyboard both for feel and backlight The unit itself is very compact  well built and lightweight for what it provides Cooling is excellent and the unit never thermal throttled while gaming or benchmarking which for a gaming laptop is the top criteria With the Nvidia RTX 3050  I was able to play World of Warcraft at Ultra 10 max settings with Raytracing set to high which is the max setting While some may be wary of the 4 core  8 thread 10th gen 10300h CPU  it was more than up to the task for gaming as the GPU was the bottleneck even at 1080p showing the gaming prowess of Intel s 10th gen CPUsThis would have been an easy 5 stars for me  but that display may be a deal breaker for a select few I can deal with the poor response time as I am not a super fast twitch hardcore gamer and I had no problems gaming for hours  but the dismal color gamut and backlight bleed of what is known to be a poor gamers panel just drops it down a notchStill  for the actual price of the unit please don t give in to scalpers  you are getting a lot of gaming power that even as is  will game right out of the box Within 20 minutes I had WoW installed and was playing and get the job done at a very economical price especially in these trying timesConsidering the price  performance and build  it still nets a 55 I picked this up for lower end internet gaming  and am typing the review on it now Performance is peppy  solid wifi  nice display and good quality components On the pro side  I like the feel of the keyboard  and that the setup was pretty quick and painless  I was on line in an hour  so not bad at all On the con side  this thing gets HOT on my lap while playing games  enough so that I got out a laptop cooling pad It has the usual bloatware that you always get on these consumer grade machines  but it was surprisingly easy to get rid of I suspect the image was several months old  since I had to go through a couple of cycles of Windows updates to get current  but all the drivers were up to date and I had no issues getting updates to apply I charged it up before using it and got four hours on a charge  even with all the downloads and rebooting several times  and it charged up to full again in less than an hour while I was using it  so the battery is acceptable Up to the usual Acer standards  it works  and it seems solid The CPU isn t the best it could be for the money  the gpu is a 3050 which reviews are saying this mobile version is inferior to the old RX 580 from AMD  which means it s not very good at all and only has 4gb of vram  the amount of RAM and storage is also low But they give you a 144htz screen It does not make sense and for the money you could get better If you want to game a 3060 should be the least you accept  since the 3050 is quite poor outside of old games or very low spec modern onesIt s rather overpriced to me and I m not impressed with the cost cutting they did Acer has built a really nice entrylevel gaming laptop here that s quite capable scoring over 4900 points in Time Spy and relatively nice looking  it has some gamer aesthetic touches like the red vents on the back and the red keyboard lighting but nothing too showyThe star of the show here is undoubtedly the graphics onetwo punch of the Intel integrated graphics for long battery life when web browsingconsuming mediadoing office work paired with the discrete nVidia GeForce RTX 3050 for gaming Long battery here is relative  I could see it going for maybe 78 hours if you turn down the brightness just doing normal office workweb browsing on WiFi Oddly  the keyboard backlight seems to take significant battery  so turn that off would help The process is strong enough and balances well with the GPU  but a Core i5 4 core  8 thread is mainstream here Unlike most modern ultrabooks which this is decidedly not at it s size  this laptop has tons of upgrade potential with room to add a second PCIe NVMe drive and a 25  SATA SSD or HDD for more storage It also has an open RAM slot  I would highly recommend adding a second 8GB stick to get to 16GB in dual channel which ups performance significantly  particularly on the integrated GPU or when multitasking Accessing these slots is slightly challenging as the bottom of the laptop must be removed  which involves 10 small screws and prying off the plastic The port selection is good  with a collapsible ethernet port a nice addition to USB 30  HDMI and USBC The USBC port sadly doesn t support power in  and so you must use the AC adapter which plugs into the back of the laptop in an odd move in recent timesBeyond the core of the CPUGPU combo  the rest of the package shows the budget nature a bit more  the keyboard only offers red backlighting and is soso  it s ok to type on but I dislike the design choice of chopping the shift button to give space to the arrow keysthough in gaming the arrow keys are more important The laptop itself is mostly plastic  which is also ok as it s inoffensive  but not as premium as many other laptops today The only real glaring bad here though is the screen While it s big and fairly bright  and offers a strong 144hz refresh rate  the color reproduction is poor compared to other laptops I ve used recently and certainly vs desktop screens Oranges tend to appear red and bluesgreens dull  it s certainly workable  but may have you plugging in an external monitor when you canOverall  if you don t need the color accuracy and don t mind the aesthetic touches  this is a good reasonably priced gaming laptop that can also do double duty as a workproductivity machine You get a lot of power for the price  but get that second RAM stick  it s worth it Not a heavy gamer  so I needed something that can play inde to AAA games just incase I ve played stardew valley and subnautica with no issue on either Was shipped to me in 4 days overworld shipment  the product is very good and has a very good value Reci칠n sacada de la caja y no encendi칩 Me a encantado la laptop me a corrido todos los juegos que le e instalado sin problemas  y eso que solo tiene 8 gb de Ram For the price I think it s a solid deal honestly Added a second ram stick an a 1tb sad and it is solid great for a first time of player anyone has the laptop does not power on just push it firmly and u will have it working  u can change the charger it may help then ask for a refund Got this laptop for gaming and it runs great I love this laptop  it is able to play almost every modern game at fps over 40 and most stay above 60 if their settings are set for boosting fps I like it 3so far Very bad for gaming  the refresh rate is very good but overall this laptop is terrible couldn t even run gts 5 on low settings online 游녩游 Pretty good price for an amazing laptop estupenda computadora por el precio que tiene Para trabajar en familia No tiene mucha memoria So far no problems I love it Me agrada This is the laptop to get if you want to game on a moderately sized portable laptop and don t mind opening up the laptop to upgrade itThe laptop has nice mid range specs for gaming overall Full backlit keyboard with numpad  silky smooth 144hz matte screen  and an RTX 3050 Graphics GPU that will crank out those frames without excessive compromise to detail  and is even capable of light VR The 8 thread Intel i5 10300H CPU uses older 14nm lithography than the current gen 10nm stuff so efficiency and heat will suffer slightly  but it is nevertheless perfectly adequate as most games are not CPU intensive anywayFor a 1000 laptop  the memory is equipped more like a web browsing thinandlight laptop than the moderatelythickandmoderatelyportable gaming laptop it is The 256gb SSD performs well for load times but will fill up rapidly if you aren t careful  considering some modern titles take up 100gb or more 8GB RAM is adequate for many games  but has potential being a major bottleneck as the system itself consumes 3gb of your 8gb just idlingIf you don t want to be limited to a small amount of browser tabs in your powerful gaming laptop  then you will need to upgrade the RAM An additional 8GB 3200mhz PC425600 DDR4 SODIMM RAM will run you about 3050 at current prices Thankfully  the laptop can be easily opened by opening up the bottom panel  with nothing more than a typical x shape Phillips screwdriver and a prying tool There are no 랑arranty void stickers sealing the interior and you won t damage anything as long as you are gentle There are 2 RAM slots  the 8gb of preinstalled RAM is thankfully a single stick that only takes one slot and I was able to insert and use a 3rd party ram stick of equal speed and capacity  no problemAs mentioned  256gb is a very limited amount of disk space that may not work for everyone  but you cannot simply slide in an extra SSD There is space for a 25 slot but that slot is not equipped with a SATA connector  so if you want to upgrade the storage you will either have to rely on an external dongle the USB 3 ports are capable of at least 1 GBs speed  or clone the system from the factory SSD onto a larger SSD There also may or may not be a pin on the motherboard that you can buy a SATA connector for but I don t know enough about motherboards to say for sureThere is also no SD or micro SD card slot at all I find it very interesting that Acer is omitting the SD card slot in multiple product lines ranging from small ultrabooks to their big 17 gaming laptop  to this laptop as well Given the small disk space  an integrated card reader would have provided an easy way to upgrade storageThe coaxial barrel charge port is interesting it is centered on the rear between the exhaust ports  rather than on the side Power consumption when idling with the screen on is about 35W Power consumption in a stress test pushing cpu  gpu and screen brightness to the max with no peripherals connected is measured at 154W When stress tested in this state  displayed GPU temperature hovers at 62C in a well ventilated 76F environmentThe exhaust shoots out the back and to the side as well  so if you use this sitting next to someone you may annoy your neighbor with hot laptop exhaust This does include a battery management option to limit to 80  and I recommend you turn this on as keeping the battery charged at 100 is bad for longevity The option can be accessed in the ㄹcer care center in the 띾heckup section 5748 watt hours is the size of the relatively small battery pack The battery does not contain any special technology to supply 150W of power  it is only capable of 60W output so when unplugged you get an hour of use with significantly reduced performance Interestingly Acer uses the same battery pack for the larger and more powerful 17 3050Ti model of the Nitro 5  so if you intend on gaming on battery power  there isn t much benefit to getting the 17 model in terms of performance since the RTX 3050 GPU itself is able to gobble more than 60W the TGP power use can be as high as 80W and the battery will be the main bottleneck anyway The laptop is able to supply at least 15W to at least 1 USB port Nothing too fancy but a decent amount of power for more hungry usb peripherals By default the backlight turns off after 30 seconds but this behavior can be disabled in Acer Nitro Red is a good eye friendly color for keyboard backlights  providing illumination without distractionI did achieve 950mbps on wired gigabit internet The laptop has a type C port but does not charge itself by type C at all  the main purpose of the type C port is for information transfer Usually laptops with C ports allow charging from type c which is cool because type C charging is much more convenient than AC charging  plus there is the potential of using a power bank The much more expensive Dell XPS17 charges by type C from its 130W charger  yet this Nitro 5 with similar power consumption refuses to draw any power from the wall type C charger at all To be clear  laptops don t need the charger to supply the full power  if the external power is weak then they will simply enter a deficit and slowly drain down the battery Volume and brightness buttons are in a weird place fnarrow keys rather than on the function key rowSilky smooth 144hz screen for competitive gaming and other high framerate content You get a normal amount of bezels and no touchscreen which is fine by me 1080p is plenty for enjoying gaming and movies  a bit low for productivity The matte screen isn t too bright but does a good job making the screen usable in bright light  the difference between max brightness and minimum brightness is around 3Watts of power It s a cliche  but you get what you pay forThis gaming laptop is about the bottom of the barrel in terms of laptop gaming systems The RAM  storage  CPU and GPU are about as low as you d want to go for modern gaming titles  especially with a 144Hz display Here are my overall thoughtsBUILDThe entire body is made of plastic I have another gaming laptop that was priced similarly and has a metal case The body of this laptop feels pretty cheap  so take good care of itRAMSTORAGE8GB of RAM for 2021 gaming makes little sense I understand this is a budget laptop  but an extra 8GB of RAM is so cheap 40  it makes no sense not to include it An upgrade after purchase to 16GB is highly recommended Yes  you can play most titles at 8GB  but you will lose a few frames and you cannot multitask or  alttab  while playing as you will run out of RAM The speed 2933Mhz is adequate  though 3200 would have been nice I also measured the read speed of this laptop s SSD at around 1800Mbps  which tells me it s not the highest quality TLC Gen3x4 NVMe drive I have had other NVMe SSDs read at around 3400MbpsCPUGPUThe CPU is good Even though it s only a 10th Gen i5 Quad core  Intel chips do very well with gaming and it boosts up to around 45GHz  so it s quite snappy while playing games or doing anything really The GPU is pretty pathetic  however  The RTX 3050 is the least competent of all the RTX GPUs While it sounds nice having a 3000 series raytracing card  the fact is  this is even slower than a 2060  and it only has 4GB of VRAM That might be a dealbreaker for most  and I can understand why Some of the games I installed  such as Watch Dogs Legion  refuse to go over 40 frames consistently because of this inadequacyCOOLINGThis is where the laptop excels  for me anyway During gaming  while on battery or AC power  the laptop was able to keep the CPU and the case fairly cool relatively speaking most of the time Sure  there will be CPU spikes in the 90s Celsius  most of the time  but that s normal for laptops especially gaming laptops  and this stays in the 70s or 80s most of the time to prevent thermal throttling The case of the laptop also stays cooler than some other  albeit more powerful  gaming laptops I ve used This could be due to the fact that it s made of plastic rather than metalEXPANDABILITYGood The laptop comes with an extra NVMe slot  a spot for a 25  SSD or hard drive and an extra RAM slot Upgrading the laptop just requires removing some screws around 10 or so and prying the back of the case offOverall  this is not a bad laptop overall However  as a gaming laptop it is lacking  and doesn t make a lot of sense My main issue is that it is built with some of the most lowend CPU and GPU yet it has a 144Hz display Unless you are playing eSports exclusively  it s doubtful you ll ever get much more than 50 or 60 frames out of the games at medium to high settings Sure  you can probably turn the settings down to their lowest levels in most games and get higher frames  but is it worth it just for the higher refresh ratee That s up to you  which leads me to my final point If you don t care about highquality textures  ambient occlusion and antialiasing features  this laptop is great for you You can turn down ingame settings and enjoy the higher refresh rate However  if  like me  you enjoy highquality textures and shadows and even some ray tracing  you might want to plop down an extra Benjamin for the next step up My wife and I like to do some casual gaming now and then  and the most intensive games that we ve played in the past year are Divinity Original Sin 2  7 Days to Die  and L4D2 We general don t need the fastest computers to get decent framerates at 1080pThe 2021 Nitro 5 is a decent upgrade for an aging Predator Helios 300 i77700HQ  1060 6GB that we ve been using It scored a 4824 in 3DMark TimeSpy  which is a pretty significant improvement over the 3900 achieved by the older Helios 300 After upgrading the Nitro 5 to 16GB 2 x 8GB  the score went up to 4932 You can see the two screen grabs attached to my reviewThe two Acer laptops actually use the same rated 180W 195V power supply  but the newer one that came with the Nitro 5 is considerably more compact The power connectors are the same too  and I ve been able to use the two power supplies interchangeably with both laptopsThe Nitro 5 comes with a single 8GB stick of Hynix DDR4 3200 RAM  and CPUZ reports that it is single rank You also get a Western Digital SN530 256GB SSD that provides very nice performance for an OEM drive From what I could gather  the SN530 might be the OEM equivalent of the popular SN550 not 100 sureDespite being an entry level laptop  Acer provides some really nice upgrade options There are two RAM slots  one already taken up with the 8GB of Hynix The system has TWO PCIE slots one taken up by the SN530 and a 25  drive tray The cable and screws for a 25  drive are included in separate plastic bags I opted to install a spare NVME SSD into the the second PCIE slotThe build quality feels pretty good for a plastic gaming laptop  and it s significantly lighter than our Helios 300 2017 and Omen 15 2018 Removing the bottom panel to access the RAM and HDD slots is easy enough you have to remove a number of screws  and then you can pry the panel away without even using a spudger toolThe keyboard feels fine to me  but I ve never had strong opinions about keyboards The touchpad is surprisingly good for a Windows touchpad it might be the best one I ve used on a Windows laptop so far  but that s also not saying much It s still not quite as good as the Mac touchpad  but it s getting closerThe screen is fairly impressive as well  supporting 1080p at 144hz This is my first experience with a GSync monitor  and it s pretty amazing Everything in Windows looks very smooth and it s hard to go back after gaming with a high refresh rate My only minor complaint is that the image looks slightly washed out at full brightness  but this is pretty easily fixed by turning down the game brightness a bitSupposedly  there s a recent or upcoming Acer firmware that increases the TGP of the GPU from 70W to 75W  but I couldn t find any specific versions or release dates regarding this as of July 2021 My laptop came with firmware v203  which is currently the latest versionOverall  this laptop is pretty good value for casual gamers who want something portable The 70W75W RTX 3050 isn t going to amaze anyone  but it s pretty good for 1080p gaming Coupled with the i510300H CPU  this entrylevel laptop offers solid improvements over our midrange Helios 300 from 2017 Do not buy There isn t enough memory to even download games on this laptop 2 if your lucky Good laptop for playing games at medium settings at a steady 60fps on certain games 8gb of ram is not enough though recommend upgrading to 16gb of ram if you plan on playing games Otherwise no issues when using it for the first time and runs great Bought this as a Christmas gift for my oldest son for gaming  it works great and he is having a blast plating all his favorite games I normally don t write reviews but I was so impressed I had to First of all  came 3 days sooner than predicted which is a win of itself The packaging was pretty well protected and came with a nice little lanyard The display is sharp and the speed is fast It didn t break the bank overall a great laptop I loved this laptop High speed with graphics memory but hard disk capacity is not enough for me DoA  1 Star for now  Purchased as a Christmas gift for my child and when she opened it and we got it plugged in  It will not power on or charge  It shows no indication of charging the light is on not when plugged in Tried troubleshooting but none of the suggested methods I found work  I Would not recommend this product The computer came dead and unable to charge A complete disappointment And Amazon did NOT refund the purchase for days after I sent it back I highly discourage a big item purchase through Amazon This is great for light gaming but don t expect high fps I saw someone complaining about it not having enough storage This laptop comes with a extra m2 slot and a 25  SSD slot It s easy to upgrade storage and ram It s a really good laptop It can run so many games I play Valorant  Minecraft  OW and more and I haven t came across any issues while gaming I also use it for school when I m not playing anything I suggest having it plugged in while using itplaying  other than that  everything is gooood  I m really happy with it D Fast work  bright display  8GB ram is low for some programming Update It s fine  you need to push in the charger really hard For the price you can t go wrong Acer hasn t treated me wrong yet 100 would recommend It runs pretty good Broken right out of the box Did not charge and did not turn on Llego con la pantalla da침ada gran producto con el detalle del teclado en ingles Thing was broken  doesn t turn on at all give me my money back La mejor calidad precio Best budget gaming laptop for getting started 144Hz refresh rate gives smooth scrolling and gaming Got ir under 800 and its a very good laptop Playing games like witcher 3 flawlessly The cooling is nice in this laptop  and mi cpu doesn t get pass 55춿 in cold rooms while playing witcher which is the game im currently playing The computer wouldn t charge straight out of the box I plugged it into every available outlet  all of which work I made sure every connection point was snug  and that the charger was fully into the laptop  and still no charge quiero agradecerte hoy recibimos nuestra nueva laptor super r치pido y muy oportuna todo venia muy bien empacado y el producto en optimas condiciones que gusto hacer negocios con alguien tan serio y cumplido mil gracias Frames will be locked at 60 automatically  you have to change the settings yourself The laptop can barely run a small game without issues  I m kind of disappointed I use this 랂aming laptop for everything besides gaming now Could not tell you anything about it because It was damaged I received the laptop and couldn t figure out why it wasn t charging Read a lot of reviews to see what the problem was and after 20 minutes I just pushed the charger into port harder until it clicked a second time La pantalla no es tan buena porque cuando juegas se ve como una clase de l칤nea rara pero corre muy bien los Juegos solo necesita que le metas m치s ram y listo Good but the charger didn t fit Luckily my son had one that fir Gpu only limited to 30W on battery  meaning mist be pluged in using dgpuAlso you cannot undervolt the cpu  it throttles beyond 75CThis suits a perfect gaming stationary pc for TV setup Product upon arrival would not turn on  or take a charge The media could not be loaded \\xa0Es una muy buena laptop  f치cil de upgradear  una pantalla que si

producto a un buen precioAhora a hacer el upgrade de ram y almacemamiento I m so sad  I got this for Christmas and it doesn t even turn on I plugged it in and no lights or anything I m just so bummed I got this for Christmas and my heart lit up with joy only to just crumple up when the computer doesn t even work Don t buy this  save yourself from the misery on Christmas morning This was great  untill the keyboard died about a week after warranty expired Tech support quoted almost 400 to fixIt was awesome  until it stopped working I was hoping to use this for at least 3 years before getting a new one I ve had this laptop for almost two years and the main problem I have with it Is it over heating and it doesnt stay charged long Worst computer the hinges broke in 1 year did not last would not buy The media could not be loaded \\xa0Really good laptop but the Esc button gets stuck and is annoying I will like to fix it but is a really powerful laptop for entrylevel gaming  I thought it was dead on arrival  but you have to really pay attention to how you plug it the port in the back There is an extra pin that clicks when you push a little harder I learned this after a mild panic attack and much researchAs a single mom I bought this laptop on Black Friday With working in retail I didn t have a chance to open it and charge itload it with all the cool things from Steam before Christmas Eve when I was about to wrap it  saying I had to work but secretly went to a friends house to wrap gifts When plugging it in  the charge light didn t light up I must have unpluggedtested the outlets a million times  crying because all my son wanted for christmas was a gaming laptopAfter some googling I found a forum talking about this Glad I did I ll update and see how it actually performs once my son starts gaming on itWhat a heart attack for no reason It should really specify this  because when you just plug it in there is a click before you have to push harder  for another click to charge Muy buena laptop  para jugar est치 incre칤ble  quiz치 no tiene tanta memoria pero se puede expandir Lo 칰nico  malo  fue que me tardo 1mes en llegar  parec칤a de Ali expr칠ss Haha  15 d칤as en confirmar y 15 en llegar a칰n habiendo pagado priorityLa seguir칠 usando y m치s adelante ver칠 si actualizo mi comentario De verdad que esta computadora me ha soprendido  anteriormente tenia una laptop Thunderobot con una RTX 3060 comprada en Ali la cual la vendi por que alguien me la quiso comprar y entonces al andar buscando otra laptop me tope con esta la cual la recomendaban en una pagina de expertos en gaming  el dia que la compra estaba en 19 999   dije bueno ok   12 mil menos que la computadora anterior   voy a darme la oportunidad de comprarla al cabo que Amazon acepta devoluciones  total que me llego en 9 dias  inmediatamente la destape ya que averigue que no pierdes la garantia al hacer lo  le aumente la memoria RAM para que dar en 16GB  le coloque un NVMe Samsung 970 evo plus de 1TB  y un disco mecanico 25 Sata de 1 Tb  ya con todo listo y funcionando   instale sniper elite 4  dead stranding  control  wolfenstein young blood  microsofot flight simulator 2021 Forza Horizon 4  Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts  Halo Master Chief  A Plague Tale Innocence  Ori and the Will of the Wisps Doom Eternal NBA 2K Play Grounds entre otros   de todos estos juegos el unico que me dio Lag fue el forza Horizon 4  pero todos los demas los he jugado sin problema alguno  sinceramente recomiendo esta computadora  si quieres mayor potencia  te aconsejo que te armes una de escritorio con una rtx 3070 como minimo  porque entre esta laptop y una rtx 3060 no vi mucha diferencia en los juegos lo unico malo que el precio se ha elevado bastante  al momento que estoy escribiendo esta rese침a ya va en 27 y fraccion  ojala la vuelvan a bajar o la puedan encontrar en otra en mejor precio I have read the bad reviews and decided to go ahead and yes indeed  it  does not start  at all Actually  u just need to press the adaptor hard enough to hear a click Once done  u can run it on battery or charger It will not turn on probably to save the battery life while on storageShipping is amazing and very light  bright and powerful Loving it but keeping my fingers crossed'"

laptop thunderobot con una rtx 3060 comprada en ali la cual la vendi por que alguien la quiso comprar entonces al andar buscando otra laptop tope con esta la cual la recomendaban en una pagina de expertos en gaming el dia que la compra estaba en 19 999 dije bueno ok 12 mil menos que la computadora anterior voy darme la oportunidad de comprarla al cabo que amazon acepta devoluciones total que llego en 9 dias inmediatamente la destape ya que averigue que pierdes la garantia al hacer lo le aumente la memoria ram para que dar en 16gb le coloque un nvme samsung 970 evo plus de 1tb un disco

contracts halo master chief a plague tale innocence ori will wisps doom eternal nba 2k play grounds entre otros de todos estos juegos el unico que dio lag fue el forza horizon 4 pero todos los demas los jugado sin problema alguno sinceramente recomiendo esta computadora si quieres mayor potencia te aconsejo que te armes una de escritorio con una rtx 3070 como minimo porque entre esta laptop una rtx 3060 vi mucha diferencia en los juegos lo unico malo que el precio se ha elevado bastante al momento que estoy escribiendo esta rese침a ya va en 27 fraccion ojala la vuelvan bajar la puedan encontrar en otra en mejor precio read bad reviews decided go ahead yes indeed start actually u need press adaptor hard enough hear click once done u run battery charger it turn probably save battery

adelante ver칠 si actualizo mi comentario de verdad que esta computadora ha soprendido anteriormente tenia una laptop thunderobot con una rtx 3060 comprada en ali la cual la vendi por que alguien la quiso comprar entonce al andar buscando otra laptop tope con esta la cual la recomendaban en una pagina de experto en gaming el dia que la compra estaba en 19 999 dije bueno ok 12 mil menos que la computadora anterior voy darme la oportunidad de comprarla al cabo que amazon acepta devolucione total que llego en 9 dias inmediatamente la destape ya que averigue que pierde la garantia al hacer lo le aumente la memoria ram para que dar en 16 gb le coloque un nvme samsung 970 evo plus de 1 tb un disco mecanico 25 sata de 1 tb ya con todo listo funcionando instale sniper elite 4 dead stranding control wolfenstein young blood microsofot flight simulator 2021 forza horizon 4 sniper ghost warrior contract halo master chief a plague tale innocence ori will wisp doom eternal nba 2k play ground entre otros de todos estos juegos el unico que dio lag fue el forza horizon 4 pero todo los demas los jugado sin problema alguno sinceramente recomiendo esta computadora si quiere mayor potencia te aconsejo que te arm una de escritorio con una rtx 3070 como minimo porque entre esta laptop una rtx 3060 vi mucha diferencia en los juegos lo unico malo que el precio se ha elevado bastante al momento que estoy escribiendo esta rese침a ya va en 27 fraccion ojala la vuelvan bajar la puedan encontrar en otra en mejor precio read bad review decide go ahead yes indeed start actually u need press adaptor hard enough hear click once do u run battery charger it turn probably save battery life storageshippe amazing light bright powerful love keep finger cross'"

       " 'I m definitely loving this laptop.I have a gaming rig with a Ryzen 5 3rd gen and XFX main card  and this laptop holds up with all the AAA titles I play on my big rig  BUT I can take it anywhere!The only reason this gets a 4 star is because it clearly states that there are supposed to be 2 stick (PCIE) SSD slots with a 2.5  HDD port to upgrade storage.When I popped this bugger open to add storage and RAM  low and behold I find it has only 1 stick SSD slots and a 2.5 Luckily I bought a 2.5  SSD instead of a stick (PCIE) since this thing clearly has a spot on the MB to have that extra PCIE slot but there is nothing there.',\n",
       " 'So basically I get 1 PCIE and 1 2.5  HDD port instead of 2.Super disappointed  considering there is even a Nitro 5 sticker that says  Available slots: 2 SSD  1 HDD Unfortunately not true at all.....',\n",

       " 'I am a 66yr old man with Red/Green colour blindness.',\n",

       " 'I was really looking forward to using this laptop  and even used my free trial of Amazon prime I d been saving so I could get it over my vacation from work.',\n",
       " 'Having gotten two defective laptops just killed that for me.',\n",
       " 'Just to cut to it  this specific model of the Nitro 5 is incredibly a solid all-around; from the lots of room to expand storage/RAM  great keyboard  good cooling  etc..',\n",
       " 'The performance is great as well as it can play most modern games at 1080 ultra settings at great FPS.The negatives for me come in two-fold: the display and battery life.1.',\n",
       " 'The display being 144hz and IPS is great and all  but the actual quality of it is below mediocre.',\n",
       " 'While backlight bleed is expected for an IPS panel  it s weirdly uneven and discolored.',\n",
       " 'Also  I m not sure if it s a defect with my specific device  but the display can t produce the color red accurately (it s more orangish) and overall things look a bit flat and there s no way to actually fix it besides finding your own ICC file.',\n",
       " 'And even then you might as well use an external monitor.2.',\n",
       " 'The battery life is terrible.',\n",
       " 'Even on powersaving mode the laptop barely lasts 5 hours  and that s just doing basic internet browsing.',\n",
